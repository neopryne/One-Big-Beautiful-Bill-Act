TITLE I
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
SEC. 101. (a) The Congress, recognizing the profound impact of
man’s activity on the interrelations of all components of the natural
environment, particularly the profound influences of population
growth, high-density urbanization, industrial expansion, resource
exploitation, and new expanding technological advances and recog-
nizing further the critical importance of restoring and maintaining
environmental quality to the overall welfare and development of
man, declares that it is the continuing policy of the Federal Gov-

ticable means and measures, including financial and technical as-
sistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general
welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and
nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, eco-
nomic, and other requirements of present and future generations of
Americans.
(b) In order to carry out the policy set forth in this Act, it is
the continuing responsibility of the Federal Government to use all
practicable means, consistent with other essential considerations of
national policy, to improve and coordinate Federal plans, functions,
programs and resources to the end that the Nation may—
(1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee
of the environment for succeeding generations;
(2) assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive,
and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;
(3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the envi-
ronment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other
undersirable and unintended consequences;
(4) preserve important historic, cultural, and natural as-
pects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever pos-
sible, an environment which supports diversity and variety of
individual choice;
(5) achieve a balance between population and resource use
which will permit high standards of living and a wide sharing
of life’s amenities; and
(6) enhance the quality of renewable resources and ap-
proach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable re-
sources.
(c) The Congress recognizes that each person should enjoy a
healthful environment and that each person has a responsibility to
contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environ-
ment.

SEC. 106. PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF LEVEL OF REVIEW.
(a) THRESHOLD DETERMINATIONS.—An agency is not required
to prepare an environmental document with respect to a proposed
agency action if—
(1) the proposed agency action is not a final agency action
within the meaning of such term in chapter 5 of title 5, United
States Code;
(2) the proposed agency action is excluded pursuant to one
of the agency’s categorical exclusions, another agency’s categor-
ical exclusions consistent with section 109 of this Act, or an-
other provision of law;
(3) the preparation of such document would clearly and
fundamentally conflict with the requirements of another provi-
sion of law; or
(4) the proposed agency action is a nondiscretionary action
with respect to which such agency does not have authority to
take environmental factors into consideration in determining
whether to take the proposed action.
(b) LEVELS OF REVIEW.—
(1) E NVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT.—An agency shall
issue an environmental impact statement with respect to a
proposed agency action requiring an environmental document
that has a reasonably foreseeable significant effect on the qual-
ity of the human environment.
(2) ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT.—An agency shall pre-
pare an environmental assessment with respect to a proposed
agency action that does not have a reasonably foreseeable sig-
nificant effect on the quality of the human environment, or if
the significance of such effect is unknown, unless the agency
finds that the proposed agency action is excluded pursuant to
one of the agency’s categorical exclusions, another agency’s cat-
egorical exclusions consistent with section 109 of this Act, or
another provision of law. Such environmental assessment shall
be a concise public document prepared by a Federal agency to
set forth the basis of such agency’s finding of no significant im-
pact or determination that an environmental impact statement
is necessary.
(3) SOURCES OF INFORMATION.—In making a determination
under this subsection, an agency—
(A) may make use of any reliable data source; and
(B) is not required to undertake new scientific or tech-
nical research unless the new scientific or technical re-
search is essential to a reasoned choice among alter-
natives, and the overall costs and time frame of obtaining
it are not unreasonable.
