part A was in effect prior to the date of enactment of the Higher
Education Amendments of 1998, or part B of such title as part B
was in effect prior to the date of enactment of the Higher Edu-
cation Amendments of 1992, is used as an academic facility for 20
years following completion of such construction, the public benefit
accruing to the United States will equal in value the amount of the
grant. The period of 20 years after completion of such construction
shall therefore be deemed to be the period of Federal interest in
such facility for the purposes of such title as so in effect.
(b) RECOVERY UPON CESSATION OF PUBLIC BENEFIT.—If, within
20 years after completion of construction of an academic facility
which has been constructed, in part with a grant under part A of
title VII as such part A was in effect prior to the date of enactment

as such part B was in effect prior to the date of enactment of the
Higher Education Amendments of 1992—
(1) the applicant under such parts as so in effect (or the
applicant’s successor in title or possession) ceases or fails to be
a public or nonprofit institution; or
(2) the facility ceases to be used as an academic facility,
or the facility is used as a facility excluded from the term ‘‘aca-
demic facility’’ (as such term was defined under title VII, as so
in effect), unless the Secretary determines that there is good
cause for releasing the institution from its obligation,
the United States shall be entitled to recover from such applicant
(or successor) an amount which bears to the value of the facility
at that time (or so much thereof as constituted an approved project
or projects) the same ratio as the amount of Federal grant bore to
the cost of the facility financed with the aid of such grant. The
value shall be determined by agreement of the parties or by action
brought in the United States district court for the district in which
such facility is situated.
(c) P ROHIBITION ON USE FOR RELIGION.—Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections (a) and (b), no project assisted with funds
under title VII (as in effect prior to the date of enactment of the
Higher Education Amendments of 1998) shall ever be used for reli-
gious worship or a sectarian activity or for a school or department
of divinity.

(1) there are a significant number of institutions of higher
education serving high percentages of minority students and
students from low-income backgrounds, that face problems that
threaten their ability to survive;
(2) the problems relate to the management and fiscal oper-
ations of certain institutions of higher education, as well as to
an inability to engage in long-range planning and development
activities, including endowment building;
(3) in order to be competitive and provide a high-quality
education for all, institutions of higher education should im-
prove their technological capacity and make effective use of
technology;
(4) the title III program prior to 1985 did not always meet
the specific development needs of historically Black colleges
and universities and other institutions with large concentra-
tions of minority, low-income students;
(5) the solution of the problems of these institutions would
enable them to become viable, fiscally stable and independent,
thriving institutions of higher education;

hance the role of such institutions in providing access and
quality education to low-income and minority students;

ican system of higher education, and there is a strong national
interest in assisting them in solving their problems and in sta-
bilizing their management and fiscal operations, and in becom-
ing financially independent; and
(8) there is a particular national interest in aiding those
institutions of higher education that have historically served
students who have been denied access to postsecondary edu-
cation because of race or national origin and whose participa-
tion in the American system of higher education is in the Na-
tion’s interest so that equality of access and quality of postsec-
ondary education opportunities may be enhanced for all stu-
dents.

tutions in equalizing educational opportunity through a program of
Federal assistance.

U NIVERSITIES
SEC. 321. ø20 U.S.C. 1060¿ FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

(1) the historically Black colleges and universities have

tunity through postsecondary education for Black, low-income,
and educationally disadvantaged Americans;

Black public institutions under the Morrill Act of 1862 and its
progeny, and against public and private Black colleges and uni-
versities in the award of Federal grants and contracts, and the
distribution of Federal resources under this Act and other Fed-
eral programs which benefit institutions of higher education;
(3) the current state of Black colleges and universities is
partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States
and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action re-
quires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary in-
stitutions to ensure their continuation and participation in ful-
filling the Federal mission of equality of educational oppor-
tunity; and
(4) financial assistance to establish or strengthen the phys-
ical plants, financial management, academic resources, and en-
dowments of the historically Black colleges and universities are
appropriate methods to enhance these institutions and facili-
tate a decrease in reliance on governmental financial support
and to encourage reliance on endowments and private sources.

PART D—HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND
UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING
SEC. 341. ø20 U.S.C. 1066¿ FINDINGS.
The Congress finds that—
(1) a significant part of the Federal mission in education
has been to attain equal opportunity in higher education for
low-income, educationally disadvantaged Americans and Afri-
can Americans;
(2) the Nation’s historically Black colleges and universities
have played a prominent role in American history and have an
unparalleled record of fostering the development of African
American youth by recognizing their potential, enhancing their
academic and technical skills, and honing their social and po-
litical skills through higher education;
(3) the academic and residential facilities on the campuses
of all historically Black colleges and universities have suffered
from neglect, deferred maintenance and are in need of capital
improvements in order to provide appropriate settings for
learning and social development through higher education;
(4) due to their small enrollments, limited endowments
and other financial factors normally considered by lenders in
construction financing, historically Black colleges and univer-
sities often lack access to the sources of funding necessary to
undertake the necessary capital improvements through bor-
rowing and bond financing;
(5) despite their track record of long-standing and remark-
able institutional longevity and viability, historically Black col-
leges and universities often lack the financial resources nec-
essary to gain access to traditional sources of capital financing
such as bank loans and bond financing; and
(6) Federal assistance to facilitate low-cost capital basis for
historically Black colleges and universities will enable such col-
leges and universities to continue and expand their educational

ENGINEERING IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
SUBPART 1—MINORITY SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING IMPROVEMENT
P ROGRAM
SEC. 350. ø20 U.S.C. 1067¿ FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) It is incumbent on the Federal Government to support
the technological and economic competitiveness of the United
States by improving and expanding the scientific and techno-
logical capacity of the United States. More and better prepared
scientists, engineers, and technical experts are needed to im-
prove and expand such capacity.
(2) As the Nation’s population becomes more diverse, it is
important that the educational and training needs of all Amer-
icans are met. Underrepresentation of minorities in science
and technological fields diminishes our Nation’s competitive-
ness by impairing the quantity of well prepared scientists, en-
gineers, and technical experts in these fields.
(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, minority
institutions provide an important educational opportunity for
minority students, particularly in science and engineering
fields. Aid to minority institutions is a good way to address the
underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological
fields.
(4) There is a strong Federal interest in improving science
and engineering programs at minority institutions as such pro-
grams lag behind in program offerings and in student enroll-
ment compared to such programs at other institutions of high-
er education.
SEC. 351. ø20 U.S.C. 1067a¿ PURPOSE; AUTHORITY.

Act. (b) The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this subpart, carry out a program of making grants to institutions
of higher education that are designed to effect long-range improve-
ment in science and engineering education at predominantly minor-

dents as a percentage of its total student population;
(3) which is contributing substantially to increasing higher
education opportunities for educationally disadvantaged,
underrepresented, or minority students, who are low-income
individuals;
(4) which is substantially increasing higher educational op-
portunities for individuals in rural or other isolated areas
which are unserved by postsecondary institutions;
(5) located on or near an Indian reservation or a substan-
tial population of Indians, if the Secretary determines that the
waiver will substantially increase higher education opportuni-

landers, including Native Hawaiians.
(b) W AIVER DETERMINATIONS; EXPENDITURES.—(1) The Sec-
retary may waive the requirements set forth in section 312(b)(1)(B)
if the Secretary determines, based on persuasive evidence sub-
mitted by the institution, that the institution’s failure to meet that
criterion is due to factors which, when used in the determination
of compliance with such criterion, distort such determination, and
that the institution’s designation as an eligible institution under
part A is otherwise consistent with the purposes of such parts.
(2) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress every other
year a report concerning the institutions which, although not satis-
fying the criterion contained in section 312(b)(1)(B), have been de-
termined to be eligible institutions under part A which enroll sig-
nificant numbers of Black American, Hispanic, Native American,
Asian American, or Native Hawaiian students under part A, as the
case may be. Such report shall—
(A) identify the factors referred to in paragraph (1) which
were considered by the Secretary as factors that distorted the

section 312(b)(1); and
(B) contain a list of each institution determined to be an
eligible institution under part A including a statement of the
reasons for each such determination.

(D) A student eligible for the total maximum Federal
Pell Grant under subparagraph (A) who has (or whose
spouse or parent, as applicable based on whose informa-
tion is used under such subparagraph, has) foreign income
that would, if added to adjusted gross income, result in the
student no longer being eligible for such total maximum
Federal Pell Grant, shall not be provided a Federal Pell
Grant until the student aid administrator evaluates the
student’s FAFSA and makes a determination regarding
whether it is appropriate to make an adjustment under
section 479A(b)(1)(B)(v) to account for such foreign income
when determining the student’s eligibility for such total
maximum Federal Pell Grant.
(E) With respect to a student who is not eligible for
the total maximum Federal Pell Grant under subpara-
graph (A) or a minimum Federal Pell Grant under sub-
paragraph (C), the Secretary shall subtract from the stu-
dent or parents’ adjusted gross income, as applicable based
on whose income is used for the Federal Pell Grant cal-
culation, the sum of the following for the individual whose
income is so used, and consider such difference the ad-
justed gross income for purposes of determining the stu-
dent’s eligibility for such Federal Pell Grant award under
such subparagraph:

tution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (in-
cluding a student who attends an institution of higher edu-
cation on less than a half-time basis) during any academic
year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant to which that stu-
dent is entitled shall be reduced in direct proportion to the de-
gree to which that student is not so enrolled on a full-time
basis, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, as pro-
vided in a schedule of reductions published by the Secretary
computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of re-
ductions shall be published in the Federal Register in accord-
ance with section 482. Such reduced Federal Pell Grant for a
student enrolled on a less than full-time basis shall also apply
proportionally to students who are otherwise eligible to receive
the minimum Federal Pell Grant, if enrolled full-time.
(3) AWARD MAY NOT EXCEED COST OF ATTENDANCE.—No
Federal Pell Grant under this subpart shall exceed the cost of
attendance (as defined in section 472) at the institution at

dent, it is determined that the amount of a Federal Pell Grant
for that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year,
the amount of the Federal Pell Grant shall be reduced until

(4) STUDY ABROAD.—Notwithstanding any other provision
of this subpart, the Secretary shall allow the amount of the
Federal Pell Grant to be exceeded for students participating in
a program of study abroad approved for credit by the institu-
tion at which the student is enrolled when the reasonable costs
of such program are greater than the cost of attendance at the
student’s home institution, except that the amount of such
Federal Pell Grant in any fiscal year shall not exceed the max-
imum amount of a Federal Pell Grant for which a student is
eligible under paragraph (1) or (2) during such award year. If
the preceding sentence applies, the financial aid administrator
at the home institution may use the cost of the study abroad
program, rather than the home institution’s cost, to determine
the cost of attendance of the student.

(C) Any period of study covered by a Federal Pell
Grant awarded under subparagraph (A) shall be included
in determining a student’s duration limit under subsection

funds appropriated for payments under this subpart are insuffi-
cient to satisfy fully all entitlements, as calculated under sub-

such appropriation), the Secretary shall promptly transmit a notice
of such insufficiency to each House of the Congress, and identify

cent, then all of such funds shall remain available for making
such payments but payments may be made under this para-
graph only with respect to entitlements for that fiscal year.
(i) TREATMENT OF INSTITUTIONS AND STUDENTS UNDER OTHER
LAWS.—Any institution of higher education which enters into an
agreement with the Secretary to disburse to students attending
that institution the amounts those students are eligible to receive

ment, a contractor maintaining a system of records to accomplish
a function of the Secretary. Recipients of Pell Grants shall not be

sure form developed by the Secretary that clearly describes the
nature of the TEACH Grant award, the service obligation, and
the loan repayment requirements that are the consequence of
the failure to complete the service obligation.
(c) REPAYMENT FOR FAILURE TO COMPLETE SERVICE.—
(1) I N GENERAL.—In the event that any recipient of a grant
under this subpart fails or refuses to comply with the service
obligation in the agreement under subsection (b), the sum of
the amounts of any TEACH Grants received by such recipient
shall, upon a determination of such a failure or refusal in such
service obligation, be treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized
Stafford Loan under part D of title IV, and shall be subject to
repayment, together with interest thereon accruing from the
date of the grant award, in accordance with terms and condi-
tions specified by the Secretary in regulations under this sub-
part.
(2) RECONSIDERATION OF CONVERSION DECISIONS.—
(A) REQUEST TO RECONSIDER.—In any case where the
Secretary has determined that a recipient of a grant under
this subpart has failed or refused to comply with the serv-
ice obligation in the agreement under subsection (b) and
has converted the grant into a Federal Direct Unsub-
sidized Stafford Loan under part D in accordance with
paragraph (1), (including a TEACH Grant converted to a
loan prior to the date of enactment of the Consider Teach-
ers Act of 2021 and including cases where such loans have
been fully or partially paid), the recipient may request that
the Secretary reconsider such initial determination and
may submit additional information to demonstrate satis-
faction of the service obligation. Upon receipt of such a re-
quest, the Secretary shall reconsider the determination in
accordance with this paragraph not later than 90 days
after the date that such request was received.

a loan prior to the date of enactment of the Consider
Teachers Act of 2021 and including cases where such loans
were fully or partially paid), the Secretary determines that
the reason for such determination was the recipient’s fail-
ure to timely submit a certification required under sub-
section (b)(1)(D) (as in effect on the day before the date of
enactment of the Consider Teachers Act of 2021), an error
or processing delay by the Secretary, a change to the fields
considered eligible for fulfillment of the service obligation
(as described in subsection (b)(1)(C)), a recipient having
previously requested to have the TEACH Grant converted
to a loan, or another valid reason determined by the Sec-
retary, and that the recipient has, as of the date of the re-
consideration, demonstrated that the recipient did meet, or
is meeting the service obligation in the agreement under
subsection (b), the Secretary shall—
(i) discharge the Federal Direct Unsubsidized
Stafford Loan under part D, and reinstate the recipi-
ent’s grant under this subpart;
(ii) discharge any interest or fees that may have
accumulated during the period that the grant was con-
verted to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
under part D;
(iii) if the recipient has other loans under part D,
apply any payments made for the Federal Direct Un-
subsidized Stafford Loan under part D during such pe-
riod to those other loans under part D;
(iv) if the recipient does not have other loans
under part D, reimburse the recipient for any amounts
paid on the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
under part D during such period;
(v) request that consumer reporting agencies re-
move any negative credit reporting due to the conver-
sion of the TEACH Grant to a loan; and
(vi) use the additional information provided under
subparagraph (A) to determine the progress the recipi-
ent has made in meeting the service obligation.
(C) EXTENSION OF TIME TO COMPLETE SERVICE OBLIGA-
TION.—In the case of a recipient whose TEACH Grant was
reinstated in accordance with subparagraph (B), the Sec-
retary shall, upon such reinstatement—
(i) extend the time remaining for the recipient to
fulfill the service obligation described in subsection
(b)(1) to a period of time equal to—
(I) 8 years; minus
(II) the number of full academic years of
teaching that the recipient completed prior to the
reconversion of the loan to a TEACH Grant under
subparagraph (B), including any years of quali-
fying teaching completed during the period when
the TEACH Grant was in loan status; and
(ii) treat any full academic years of teaching de-
scribed in clause (i)(II) as years that count toward the
individual’s service obligation (regardless of whether

section.
(d) ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.—
(1) CHANGE OF HIGH-NEED DESIGNATION.—If a recipient of
an initial grant under this subpart has acquired an academic
degree, or expertise, in a field that was, at the time of the re-
cipient’s application for that grant, designated as high need in
accordance with subsection (b)(1)(C)(vii), but is no longer so
designated, the grant recipient may fulfill the service obliga-
tion described in subsection (b)(1) by teaching in that field.
(2) EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.—The Secretary shall es-
tablish, by regulation, categories of extenuating circumstances
under which a recipient of a grant under this subpart who is
unable to fulfill all or part of the recipient’s service obligation
may be excused from fulfilling that portion of the service obli-
gation.
(3) COMMUNICATION WITH RECIPIENTS.—The Secretary
shall notify TEACH grant recipients not less than once per cal-
endar year regarding how to submit the employment certifi-
cation under subsection (b)(1)(D) and the recommendations and
requirements for submitting that certification under subsection
(d)(5).
(4) QUALIFYING SCHOOLS AND HIGH-NEED FIELDS.—The Sec-
retary shall maintain and annually update a list of qualifying
schools as described in subsection (b)(1)(B), and a list of high-
need fields as described in subsection (b)(1)(C) and shall make
such lists publicly available on the Department’s website in a
sortable and searchable format.
(5) SUBMISSION OF EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATION.—
(A) RECOMMENDED SUBMISSIONS.—The Secretary shall
notify TEACH Grant recipients that the Department rec-
ommends that TEACH Grant recipients submit the em-
ployment certification described in subsection (b)(1)(D) as
soon as practicable after the completion of each year of

shall be required to submit to the Department employment
certification within the timeframe that would allow that
individual to complete their service obligation before the

(C) NOTIFICATION.—The Secretary shall notify TEACH
Grant recipients of the required submission deadlines de-
scribed in this paragraph.
(D) ADJUSTMENT OF DEADLINE.—The Secretary shall
adjust the submission deadline described in subparagraph
(B) to account for a service obligation window extension.
(E) ALTERNATIVE TO CERTIFICATION.—The Secretary
shall provide an alternative to the certification of employ-
ment described in subsection (b)(1)(D) for recipients who
cannot obtain such required certification of employment
from the chief administrative officer of the school because
the recipient can demonstrate the school is no longer in ex-
istence or the school refuses to cooperate.

SEC. 422. ø20 U.S.C. 1072¿ ADVANCES FOR RESERVE FUNDS OF STATE
AND NONPROFIT PRIVATE LOAN INSURANCE PROGRAMS.
(a) PURPOSE OF AND AUTHORITY FOR ADVANCES TO RESERVE
FUNDS.—
(1) P URPOSE; ELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS.—From sums appro-
priated pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4)(A) of section 421(b),
the Secretary is authorized to make advances to any State
with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to
section 428(b) for the purpose of helping to establish or
strengthen the reserve fund of the student loan insurance pro-
gram covered by that agreement. If for any fiscal year a State
does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an
agreement made pursuant to section 428(b), and the Secretary
determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of
that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State
will have such a student loan insurance program for such year,
the Secretary may make advances for such year for the same
purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organi-
zations with which the Secretary has made an agreement pur-
suant to section 428(b) in order to enable students in the State
to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered
by such an agreement. The Secretary may make advances
under this subsection both to a State program (with which he
has such an agreement) and to one or more nonprofit private
institutions or organizations (with which he has such an agree-
ment) in that State if he determines that such advances are
necessary in order that students in each eligible institution
have access through such institution to a student loan insur-
ance program which meets the requirements of section
428(b)(1).
(2) MATCHING REQUIREMENT.—No advance shall be made
after June 30, 1968, unless matched by an equal amount from
non-Federal sources. Such equal amount may include the
unencumbered non-Federal portion of a reserve fund. As used
in the preceding sentence, the term ‘‘unencumbered non-Fed-
eral portion’’ means the amount (determined as of the time im-
mediately preceding the making of the advance) of the reserve
fund less the greater of—
(A) the sum of—
(i) advances made under this section prior to July
1, 1968;
(ii) an amount equal to twice the amount of ad-
vances made under this section after June 30, 1968,
and before the advance for purposes of which the de-
termination is made; and
(iii) the proceeds of earnings on advances made
under this section; or
(B) any amount which is required to be maintained in
such fund pursuant to State law or regulation, or by agree-
ment with lenders, as a reserve against the insurance of
outstanding loans.

Except as provided in section 428(c)(9)(E) or (F), such
unencumbered non-Federal portion shall not be subject to re-
call, repayment, or recovery by the Secretary.
(3) TERMS AND CONDITIONS; REPAYMENT.—Advances pursu-
ant to this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions
(including conditions relating to the time or times of payment)
consistent with the requirements of section 428(b) as the Sec-
retary determines will best carry out the purpose of this sec-
tion. Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection
shall be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem
to be appropriate in each case in the light of the maturity and
solvency of the reserve fund for which the advance was made.
(b) LIMITATIONS ON TOTAL ADVANCES.—
(1) I N GENERAL.—The total of the advances from the sums
appropriated pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of section 421(b) to
nonprofit private institutions and organizations for the benefit
of students in any State and to such State may not exceed an
amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the popu-
lation of such State aged 18 to 22, inclusive, bears to the popu-
lation of all the States aged 18 to 22 inclusive, but such ad-
vances may otherwise be in such amounts as the Secretary de-
termines will best achieve the purposes for which they are
made. The amount available for advances to any State shall
not be less than $25,000 and any additional funds needed to
meet this requirement shall be derived by proportionately re-
ducing (but not below $25,000) the amount available for ad-
vances to each of the remaining States.
(2) CALCULATION OF POPULATION.—For the purpose of this
subsection, the population aged 18 to 22, inclusive, of each
State and of all the States shall be determined by the Sec-
retary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data avail-
able to him.
(c) ADVANCES FOR INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS.—
(1) USE FOR PAYMENT OF INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS.—From
sums appropriated pursuant to section 421(b)(4)(B), the Sec-
retary shall advance to each State which has an agreement
with the Secretary under section 428(c) with respect to a stu-
dent loan insurance program, an amount determined in accord-
ance with paragraph (2) of this subsection to be used for the
purpose of making payments under the State’s insurance obli-
gations under such program.
(2) AMOUNT OF ADVANCES.—(A) Except as provided in sub-
paragraph (B), the amount to be advanced to each such State
shall be equal to 10 percent of the principal amount of loans
made by lenders and insured by such agency on those loans on
which the first payment of principal became due during the fis-
cal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the ad-
vance is made.
(B) The amount of any advance determined according to
subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be reduced by—
(i) the amount of any advance or advances made to
such State pursuant to this subsection at an earlier date;
and

(ii) the amount of the unspent balance of the advances
made to a State pursuant to subsection (a).
Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and the preceding sentence
of this subparagraph, but subject to subparagraph (D) of this
paragraph, the amount of any advance to a State described in
paragraph (5)(A) for the first year of its eligibility under such
paragraph, and the amount of any advance to any State de-
scribed in paragraph (5)(B) for each year of its eligibility under
such paragraph, shall not be less than $50,000.
(C) For the purpose of subparagraph (B), the unspent bal-
ance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection
(a) shall be that portion of the balance of the State’s reserve
fund (remaining at the time of the State’s first request for an
advance pursuant to this subsection) which bears the same
ratio to such balance as the Federal advances made and not re-
turned by such State, pursuant to subsection (a), bears to the
total of all past contributions to such reserve funds from all
sources (other than interest on investment of any portion of the
reserve fund) contributed since the date such State executed
an agreement pursuant to section 428(b).
(D) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for paying
the amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) are
not sufficient to pay such amounts in full, then such amounts
shall be reduced—
(i) by ratably reducing that portion of the amount allo-
cated to each State which exceeds $50,000; and
(ii) if further reduction is required, by equally reduc-
ing the $50,000 minimum allocation of each State.
If additional sums become available for paying such amounts
for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence has
been applied, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the
same basis as they were reduced.
(3) USE OF EARNINGS FOR INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS.—The
earnings, if any, on any investments of advances received pur-
suant to this subsection must be used for making payments
under the State’s insurance obligations.
(4) REPAYMENT OF ADVANCES.—Advances made by the Sec-
retary under this subsection shall, subject to subsection (d), be
repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be ap-
propriate and shall be deposited in the fund established by sec-
tion 431.
(5) LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF ADVANCES.—Except as pro-
vided in paragraph (7), advances pursuant to this subsection
shall be made to a State—
(A) in the case of a State which is actively carrying on
a program under an agreement pursuant to section 428(b)
which was entered into before October 12, 1976, upon such
date as such State may request, but not before October 1,
1977, and on the same day of each of the 2 succeeding cal-
endar years after the date so requested; and
(B) in the case of a State which enters into an agree-
ment pursuant to section 428(b) on or after October 12,
1976, or which is not actively carrying on a program under
an agreement pursuant to such section on such date, upon

ber 1, 1977, and on the same day of each of the 4 suc-
ceeding calendar years after the date so requested of the
advance.
(6) PAYMENT OF ADVANCES WHERE NO STATE PROGRAM.—
(A) If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan
insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to
section 428(b), and the Secretary determines after consultation
with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no
reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student
loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make
advances pursuant to this subsection for such year for the
same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or
organizations with which he has made an agreement pursuant
to subsection (c), as well as subsection (b), of section 428 and
subparagraph (B) of this paragraph in order to enable students
in that State to participate in a program of student loan insur-
ance covered by such agreements.
(B) The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a pri-
vate nonprofit institution or organization for the purpose of
this paragraph under which such institution or organization—
(i) agrees to establish within such State at least one
office with sufficient staff to handle written, electronic, and
telephone inquiries from students, eligible lenders, and
other persons in the State, to encourage maximum com-
mercial lender participation within the State, and to con-
duct periodic visits to at least the major eligible lenders
within the State;
(ii) agrees that its insurance will not be denied any
student because of his or her choice of eligible institutions;
and (iii) certifies that it is neither an eligible institution,
nor has any substantial affiliation with an eligible institu-
tion.
(7) E MERGENCY ADVANCES.—The Secretary is authorized to
make advances, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Secretary, to a guaranty agency—
(A) in accordance with section 428(j), in order to en-
sure that the guaranty agency shall make loans as the
lender-of-last-resort; or
(B) if the Secretary is seeking to terminate the guar-
anty agency’s agreement, or assuming the guaranty agen-
cy’s functions, in accordance with section 428(c)(9)(F)(v), in
order to assist the agency in meeting its immediate cash
needs, ensure the uninterrupted payment of claims, or en-
sure that the guaranty agency shall make loans as de-
scribed in subparagraph (A).
(d) RECOVERY OF ADVANCES DURING FISCAL YEARS 1988 AND
1989.— (1) AMOUNT AND USE OF RECOVERED FUNDS.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of this section, advances made by
the Secretary under this section shall be repaid in accordance
with this subsection and shall be deposited in the fund estab-
lished by section 431. The Secretary shall, in accordance with

amount equal to $75,000,000 during fiscal year 1988 and an
amount equal to $35,000,000 for fiscal year 1989.
(2) DETERMINATION OF GUARANTY AGENCY OBLIGATIONS.—
In determining the amount of advances which shall be repaid
by a guaranty agency under paragraph (1), the Secretary—
(A) shall consider the solvency and maturity of the re-
serve and insurance funds of the guaranty agency assisted
by such advances, as determined by the Comptroller Gen-
eral taking into account the requirements of State law as
in effect on the date of enactment of the Higher Education
Amendments of 1986;
(B) shall not seek repayment of such advances from
any State described in subsection (c)(5)(B) during any year
of its eligibility under such subsection; and
(C) shall not seek repayment of such advances from
any State if such repayment encumbers the reserve fund
requirement of State law as in effect on such date of enact-
ment.
(e) CORRECTION FOR ERRORS UNDER REDUCTION OF EXCESS
CASH RESERVES.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall pay any guaranty
agency the amount of reimbursement of claims under section
428(c)(1), filed between September 1, 1988, and December 31,
1989, which were previously withheld or canceled in order to
be applied to satisfy such agency’s obligation to eliminate ex-
cess cash reserves held by such agency, based on the maximum
cash reserve (as described in subsection (e) of this section as
in effect on September 1, 1988) permitted at the end of 1986,
if such maximum cash reserve was miscalculated because of er-
roneous financial information provided by such agency to the
Secretary and if (A) such erroneous information is verified by
an audited financial statement of the reserve fund, signed by
a certified public accountant, and (B) such audited financial
statement is provided to the Secretary prior to January 1,
1993.
(2) AMOUNT.—The amount of reimbursement for claims
shall be equal to the amount of reimbursement for claims with-
held or canceled in order to be applied to such agency’s obliga-
tion to eliminate excess cash reserves which exceeds the
amount of that which would have been withheld or canceled if
the maximum excess cash reserves had been accurately cal-
culated.
(f) REFUND OF CASH RESERVE PAYMENTS.—The Secretary shall,
within 30 days after the date of enactment of the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992, pay the full amount of payments withheld or
canceled under paragraph (3) of this subsection to any guaranty
agency which—
(1) was required to eliminate excess cash reserves, based
on the maximum cash reserve (as described in subsection (e)
of this section as in effect on September 1, 1988) permitted at
the end of 1986;
(2) appealed the Secretary’s demand that such agency
should eliminate such excess cash reserves and received a

to be eliminated;
(3) had payments under section 428(c)(1) or section 428(f)
previously withheld or canceled in order to be applied to satisfy
such agency’s obligation to eliminate excess cash reserves held
by such agency, based on the maximum cash reserve (as de-
scribed in subsection (e) of this section as in effect on Sep-
tember 1, 1988) permitted at the end of 1986; and
(4) according to a Department of Education review that
was completed and forwarded to such guaranty agency prior to
January 1, 1992, is expected to become insolvent during or be-
fore 1996 and the payments withheld or canceled under para-
graph (3) of this subsection are a factor in such agency’s im-
pending insolvency.
(g) PRESERVATION AND RECOVERY OF GUARANTY AGENCY RE-
SERVES.—
(1) A UTHORITY TO RECOVER FUNDS.—Notwithstanding any
other provision of law, the reserve funds of the guaranty agen-
cies, and any assets purchased with such reserve funds, re-
gardless of who holds or controls the reserves or assets, shall
be considered to be the property of the United States to be
used in the operation of the program authorized by this part.
However, the Secretary may not require the return of all re-
serve funds of a guaranty agency to the Secretary unless the
Secretary determines that such return is in the best interest
of the operation of the program authorized by this part, or to
ensure the proper maintenance of such agency’s funds or assets
or the orderly termination of the guaranty agency’s operations
and the liquidation of its assets. The reserves shall be main-
tained by each guaranty agency to pay program expenses and
contingent liabilities, as authorized by the Secretary, except
that—
(A) the Secretary may direct a guaranty agency to re-
turn to the Secretary a portion of its reserve fund which
the Secretary determines is unnecessary to pay the pro-
gram expenses and contingent liabilities of the guaranty
agency;
(B) the Secretary may direct the guaranty agency to
require the return, to the guaranty agency or to the Sec-
retary, of any reserve funds or assets held by, or under the
control of, any other entity, which the Secretary deter-
mines are necessary to pay the program expenses and con-
tingent liabilities of the guaranty agency, or which are re-
quired for the orderly termination of the guaranty agency’s
operations and the liquidation of its assets;
(C) the Secretary may direct a guaranty agency, or
such agency’s officers or directors, to cease any activities
involving expenditure, use or transfer of the guaranty
agency’s reserve funds or assets which the Secretary deter-
mines is a misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure
of such funds or assets; and
(D) any such determination under subparagraph (A) or
(B) shall be based on standards prescribed by regulations

that are developed through negotiated rulemaking and
that include procedures for administrative due process.
(2) TERMINATION PROVISIONS IN CONTRACTS.—(A) To en-
sure that the funds and assets of the guaranty agency are pre-
served, any contract with respect to the administration of a
guaranty agency’s reserve funds, or the administration of any
assets purchased or acquired with the reserve funds of the
guaranty agency, that is entered into or extended by the guar-
anty agency, or any other party on behalf of or with the con-
currence of the guaranty agency, after the date of enactment
of this subsection shall provide that the contract is terminable
by the Secretary upon 30 days notice to the contracting parties
if the Secretary determines that such contract includes an im-
permissible transfer of the reserve funds or assets, or is other-
wise inconsistent with the terms or purposes of this section.
(B) The Secretary may direct a guaranty agency to sus-
pend or cease activities under any contract entered into by or
on behalf of such agency after January 1, 1993, if the Secretary
determines that the misuse or improper expenditure of such
guaranty agency’s funds or assets or such contract provides un-
necessary or improper benefits to such agency’s officers or di-
rectors.
(3) PENALTIES.—Violation of any direction issued by the
Secretary under this subsection may be subject to the penalties
described in section 490 of this Act.
(4) AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.—Any funds that are returned
or otherwise recovered by the Secretary pursuant to this sub-
section shall be available for expenditure for expenses pursu-
ant to section 458 of this Act.
(h) RECALL OF RESERVES; LIMITATIONS ON USE OF RESERVE
FUNDS AND ASSETS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, the Secretary shall, except as otherwise provided in this
subsection, recall $1,000,000,000 from the reserve funds held
by guaranty agencies on September 1, 2002.
(2) DEPOSIT.—Funds recalled by the Secretary under this
subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury.
(3) REQUIRED SHARE.—The Secretary shall require each
guaranty agency to return reserve funds under paragraph (1)
based on the agency’s required share of recalled reserve funds
held by guaranty agencies as of September 30, 1996. For pur-
poses of this paragraph, a guaranty agency’s required share of
recalled reserve funds shall be determined as follows:
(A) The Secretary shall compute each guaranty agen-
cy’s reserve ratio by dividing (i) the amount held in the
agency’s reserve funds as of September 30, 1996 (but re-
flecting later accounting or auditing adjustments approved
by the Secretary), by (ii) the original principal amount of
all loans for which the agency has an outstanding insur-
ance obligation as of such date, including amounts of out-
standing loans transferred to the agency from another
guaranty agency.
(B) If the reserve ratio of any guaranty agency as com-
puted under subparagraph (A) exceeds 2.0 percent, the

agency’s required share shall include so much of the
amounts held in the agency’s reserve funds as exceed a re-
serve ratio of 2.0 percent.
(C) If any additional amount is required to be recalled
under paragraph (1) (after deducting the total of the re-
quired shares calculated under subparagraph (B)), such
additional amount shall be obtained by imposing on each
guaranty agency an equal percentage reduction in the
amount of the agency’s reserve funds remaining after de-
duction of the amount recalled under subparagraph (B),
except that such percentage reduction under this subpara-
graph shall not result in the agency’s reserve ratio being
reduced below 0.58 percent. The equal percentage reduc-
tion shall be the percentage obtained by dividing—
(i) the additional amount required to be recalled
(after deducting the total of the required shares cal-
culated under subparagraph (B)), by
(ii) the total amount of all such agencies’ reserve
funds remaining (after deduction of the required
shares calculated under such subparagraph).
(D) If any additional amount is required to be recalled
under paragraph (1) (after deducting the total of the re-
quired shares calculated under subparagraphs (B) and
(C)), such additional amount shall be obtained by imposing
on each guaranty agency with a reserve ratio (after de-
ducting the required shares calculated under such sub-
paragraphs) in excess of 0.58 percent an equal percentage
reduction in the amount of the agency’s reserve funds re-
maining (after such deduction) that exceed a reserve ratio
of 0.58 percent. The equal percentage reduction shall be
the percentage obtained by dividing—
(i) the additional amount to be recalled under
paragraph (1) (after deducting the amount recalled
under subparagraphs (B) and (C)), by
(ii) the total amount of all such agencies’ reserve
funds remaining (after deduction of the required
shares calculated under such subparagraphs) that ex-
ceed a reserve ratio of 0.58 percent.
(4) RESTRICTED ACCOUNTS REQUIRED.—
(A) I N GENERAL.—Within 90 days after the beginning
of each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, each guar-
anty agency shall transfer a portion of the agency’s re-
quired share determined under paragraph (3) to a re-
stricted account established by the agency that is of a type
selected by the agency with the approval of the Secretary.
Funds transferred to such restricted accounts shall be in-
vested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United
States or in other similarly low-risk securities.
(B) REQUIREMENT.—A guaranty agency shall not use
the funds in such a restricted account for any purpose
without the express written permission of the Secretary,
except that a guaranty agency may use the earnings from
such restricted account for default reduction activities.

(C) INSTALLMENTS.—In each of fiscal years 1998
through 2002, each guaranty agency shall transfer the
agency’s required share to such restricted account in 5
equal annual installments, except that—
(i) a guaranty agency that has a reserve ratio (as
computed under subparagraph (3)(A)) equal to or less
than 1.10 percent may transfer the agency’s required
share to such account in 4 equal installments begin-
ning in fiscal year 1999; and
(ii) a guaranty agency may transfer such required
share to such account in accordance with such other
payment schedules as are approved by the Secretary.
(5) SHORTAGE.—If, on September 1, 2002, the total amount

posing on each guaranty agency to which the preceding
sentence does not apply, an equal percentage reduction in
the amount of the agency’s remaining reserve funds.
(4) OFFSET OF REQUIRED SHARES.—If any guaranty agency
returns to the Secretary any reserve funds in excess of the

any nonliquid asset (such as a building or equipment) developed or
purchased by the guaranty agency in whole or in part with Federal
reserve funds, regardless of who holds or controls the Federal re-

of the United States, prorated based on the percentage of such
asset developed or purchased with Federal reserve funds, which

by this part, as provided in subsection (d). The Secretary may re-
strict or regulate the use of such asset only to the extent necessary
to reasonably protect the Secretary’s prorated share of the value of

fice of Management and Budget Circular A–87 (Cost Account-
ing Standards) from the Federal Fund for deposit into the Op-
erating Fund for use in the performance of the guaranty agen-
cy’s duties under this part. Such transfers may occur during
the first 3 years following the establishment of the Operating
Fund. However, no agency may transfer in excess of 45 percent
of the balance, as of September 30, 1998, of the agency’s Fed-
eral Fund to the agency’s Operating Fund during such 3-year
period. In determining the amount that may be transferred,

riods and to meet the reserve recall requirements of this sec-
tion and subsections (h) and (i) of section 422.

may transfer interest earned on the Federal Fund to the Oper-
ating Fund during the first 3 years after the date of enactment

retary that—
(A) the cash flow in the Operating Fund will be nega-
tive without the transfer of such interest; and
(B) the transfer of such interest will substantially im-
prove the financial circumstances of the guaranty agency.
(3) REPAYMENT PROVISIONS.—Each guaranty agency shall
begin repayment of sums transferred pursuant to this sub-
section not later than the start of the fourth year after the es-
tablishment of the Operating Fund, and shall repay all
amounts transferred not later than 5 years from the date of
the establishment of the Operating Fund. With respect to
amounts transferred from the Federal Fund, the guaranty
agency shall not be required to repay any interest on the funds
transferred and subsequently repaid. The guaranty agency
shall provide to the Secretary a reasonable schedule for repay-
ment of the sums transferred and an annual financial analysis
demonstrating the agency’s ability to comply with the schedule
and repay all outstanding sums transferred.

from the Federal Fund in accordance with this section, and
fails to make scheduled repayments to the Federal Fund, the
agency may not receive any other funds under this part until

payments. The Secretary shall pay to the guaranty agency any
funds withheld in accordance with this paragraph immediately

in accordance with paragraph (2); and
(B) waive paragraph (4);

are extenuating circumstances (such as State constitutional
prohibitions) beyond the control of the agency that justify such
a waiver.
(6) EXTENSION OF REPAYMENT PERIOD FOR INTEREST.—
(A) EXTENSION PERMITTED.—The Secretary shall ex-
tend the period for repayment of interest that was trans-
ferred in accordance with paragraph (2) from 2 years to 5
years if the Secretary determines that—
(i) the cash flow of the Operating Fund will be
negative as a result of repayment as required by para-
graph (3);
(ii) the repayment of the interest transferred will
substantially diminish the financial circumstances of
the guaranty agency; and
(iii) the guaranty agency has demonstrated—
(I) that the agency is able to repay all trans-
ferred funds by the end of the 8th year following
the date of establishment of the Operating Fund;
and
(II) that the agency will be financially sound
on the completion of repayment.
(B) REPAYMENT OF INCOME ON TRANSFERRED FUNDS.—
All repayments made to the Federal Fund during the 6th,
7th, and 8th years following the establishment of the Op-
erating Fund of interest that was transferred shall include
the sums transferred plus any income earned from the in-
vestment of the sums transferred after the 5th year.
(7) I NVESTMENT OF FEDERAL FUNDS.—Funds transferred
from the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund for operating ex-
penses shall be invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by
the United States or a State, or in other similarly low-risk se-
curities selected by the guaranty agency, with the approval of
the Secretary.

level required by section 428(c)(9)(A), the Secretary shall in-
clude all amounts owed to the Federal Fund by the guaranty
agency in the calculation.

interest to the reduction of principal to the extent provided
in paragraph (5) of this subsection.
(2) AMOUNT OF ADJUSTMENT FOR 10 PERCENT LOANS.—The
amount of any adjustment of interest on a loan to be made

in paragraph (5) of this subsection.
(4) AMOUNT OF ADJUSTMENT.—The amount of any adjust-
ment of interest on a loan to be made under this subsection for
any quarter shall be equal to—
(A) the applicable interest rate minus the sum of (i)

(5) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT OF INTEREST AND BORROWER ELI-
GIBILITY FOR CREDIT.—Any adjustment amount computed pur-
suant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection for any quar-
ter shall be credited, by the holder of the loan on the last day
of the calendar year in which such quarter falls, to the loan ac-
count of the borrower so as to reduce the principal balance of
such account. No such credit shall be made to the loan account
of a borrower who on the last day of the calendar year is delin-
quent for more than 30 days in making a required payment on
the loan, but the excess interest shall be calculated and cred-
ited to the Secretary. Any credit which is to be made to a bor-
rower’s account pursuant to this subsection shall be made ef-
fective commencing no later than 30 days following the last
day of the calendar year in which the quarter falls for which
the credit is being made. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to require refunding any repayment of a loan. At the
option of the lender, the amount of such adjustment may be
distributed to the borrower either by reduction in the amount
of the periodic payment on the loan, by reducing the number
of payments that shall be made with respect to the loan, or by
reducing the amount of the final payment of the loan. Nothing
in this paragraph shall be construed to require the lender to
make additional disclosures pursuant to section 433(b).

Such conversion shall occur not later than January 1, 1995,
and, commencing on the date of conversion, the applicable in-
terest rate for each 12-month period beginning on July 1 and
ending on June 30 shall be determined by the Secretary on the

to this part and is subject to the provisions of this subsection
to a variable rate. The interest rates for such period shall be
reset on a quarterly basis and the applicable interest rate for
any quarter or portion thereof shall equal the sum of (i) the av-
erage of the bond equivalent rates of 91-Treasury bills auc-
tioned for the preceding 3-month period, and (ii) 3.25 percent
in the case of loans described in paragraph (1) or 3.10 percent
in the case of loans described in paragraph (3). The rebate of
excess interest derived through this conversion shall be pro-
vided to the borrower as specified in paragraph (5) for loans
described in paragraph (1) or to the Government and borrower
as specified in paragraph (3).
(C) A lender or holder of a loan being converted pursuant
to this paragraph shall complete such conversion on or before
January 1, 1995. The lender or holder shall notify the borrower
that the loan shall be converted to a variable interest rate and
provide a description of the rate to the borrower not later than
30 days prior to the conversion. The notice shall advise the
borrower that such rate shall be calculated in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this paragraph and shall provide
the borrower with a substantially equivalent benefit as the ad-
justment otherwise provided for under this subsection. Such
notice may be incorporated into the disclosure required under
section 433(b) if such disclosure has not been previously made.
(D) The interest rate on a loan converted to a variable rate
pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum in-
terest rate applicable to the loan prior to such conversion.

mine the amount of the payment which he must make with re-
spect to that loan.

the Armed Forces named in section 10101 of title 10, United
States Code, is called or ordered to active duty for a period of
more than 30 days (as defined in section 101(d)(2) of such
title). Such period of exclusion shall include the period nec-

(A) D ESIGN AND SELECTION.—In accordance with regu-
lations promulgated by the Secretary, the lender shall

quire a borrower to repay a loan in less than 5 years un-
less the borrower, during the 6 months immediately pre-
ceding the start of the repayment period, specifically re-
quests that repayment be made over of a shorter period.

tended repayment plan, with a fixed annual or grad-
uated repayment amount paid over an extended period
of time, not to exceed 25 years, except that the bor-
rower shall repay annually a minimum amount deter-
mined in accordance with paragraph (1)(L)(i); and

the probable intent of Congress.

plan described in this clause shall not be available to
a borrower for a loan under section 428B made on be-
half of a dependent student or for a consolidation loan
under section 428C, if the proceeds of such loan were
used to discharge the liability of a loan under section
428B made on behalf of a dependent student.
(B) LENDER SELECTION OF OPTION IF BORROWER DOES
NOT SELECT.—If a borrower of a loan made under this part
does not select a repayment plan described in subpara-
graph (A), the lender shall provide the borrower with a re-
payment plan described in subparagraph (A)(i).
(c) GUARANTY AGREEMENTS FOR REIMBURSING LOSSES.—
(1) AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS.—(A) The Sec-
retary may enter into a guaranty agreement with any guar-
anty agency, whereby the Secretary shall undertake to reim-
burse it, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary
may establish, with respect to losses (resulting from the de-
fault of the student borrower) on the unpaid balance of the
principal and accrued interest of any insured loan. The guar-
anty agency shall, be deemed to have a contractual right
against the United States, during the life of such loan, to re-
ceive reimbursement according to the provisions of this sub-
section. Upon receipt of an accurate and complete request by
a guaranty agency for reimbursement with respect to such
losses, the Secretary shall pay promptly and without adminis-
trative delay. Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this
paragraph and in paragraph (7), the amount to be paid a guar-
anty agency as reimbursement under this subsection shall be
equal to 100 percent 11 of the amount expended by it in dis-
charge of its insurance obligation incurred under its loan in-
surance program. A guaranty agency shall file a claim for re-
imbursement with respect to losses under this subsection with-
in 30 days after the guaranty agency discharges its insurance
obligation on the loan.
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)—
(i) if, for any fiscal year, the amount of such reim-
bursement payments by the Secretary under this sub-
section exceeds 5 percent of the loans which are insured by
such guaranty agency under such program and which were
in repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year, the
amount to be paid as reimbursement under this subsection
for such excess shall be equal to 85 12 percent of the
amount of such excess; and
(ii) if, for any fiscal year, the amount of such reim-
bursement payments exceeds 9 percent of such loans, the
amount to be paid as reimbursement under this subsection

for such excess shall be equal to 75 12 percent of the
amount of such excess.
(C) For the purpose of this subsection, the amount of loans
of a guaranty agency which are in repayment shall be the
original principal amount of loans made by a lender which are
insured by such a guaranty agency reduced by—
(i) the amount the insurer has been required to pay to
discharge its insurance obligations under this part;
(ii) the original principal amount of loans insured by
it which have been fully repaid; and
(iii) the original principal amount insured on those
loans for which payment of the first installment of prin-
cipal has not become due pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(E)
of this section or such first installment need not be paid
pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(M) of this section.
(D) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section,
in the case of a loan made pursuant to a lender-of-last-resort
program, the Secretary shall apply the provisions of—
(i) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by sub-
stituting ‘‘100 percent’’ for ‘‘95 percent’’;
(ii) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting ‘‘100 percent’’
for ‘‘85 percent’’; and
(iii) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting ‘‘100 percent’’
for ‘‘75 percent’’.
(E) 13 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section,
in the case of an outstanding loan transferred to a guaranty
agency from another guaranty agency pursuant to a plan ap-
proved by the Secretary in response to the insolvency of the
latter such guarantee agency, the Secretary shall apply the
provision of—
(i) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by sub-
stituting ‘‘100 percent’’ for ‘‘95 percent’’;
(ii) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting ‘‘90 percent’’
for ‘‘85 percent’’; and
(iii) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting ‘‘80 percent’’
for ‘‘75 percent’’.
(F)(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section,
in the case of exempt claims, the Secretary shall apply the pro-
visions of—
(I) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by sub-
stituting ‘‘100 percent’’ for ‘‘95 percent’’;
(II) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting ‘‘100 percent’’
for ‘‘85 percent’’; and
(III) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting ‘‘100 percent’’
for ‘‘75 percent’’.
(ii) For purposes of clause (i) of this subparagraph, the
term ‘‘exempt claims’’ means claims with respect to loans for
which it is determined that the borrower (or the student on
whose behalf a parent has borrowed), without the lender’s or
the institution’s knowledge at the time the loan was made, pro-
vided false or erroneous information or took actions that

of-last-resort program when making reimbursement payment
calculations under subparagraphs (B) and (C).
(2) CONTENTS OF GUARANTY AGREEMENTS.—The guaranty
agreement—
(A) shall set forth such administrative and fiscal pro-
cedures as may be necessary to protect the United States
from the risk of unreasonable loss thereunder, to ensure
proper and efficient administration of the loan insurance
program, and to assure that due diligence will be exercised
in the collection of loans insured under the program, in-
cluding (i) a requirement that each beneficiary of insur-
ance on the loan submit proof that the institution was con-
tacted and other reasonable attempts were made to locate
the borrower (when the location of the borrower is un-
known) and proof that contact was made with the bor-
rower (when the location is known) and (ii) requirements
establishing procedures to preclude consolidation lending
from being an excessive proportion of guaranty agency re-
coveries on defaulted loans under this part;
(B) shall provide for making such reports, in such form
and containing such information, as the Secretary may
reasonably require to carry out the Secretary’s functions
under this subsection, and for keeping such records and for
affording such access thereto as the Secretary may find
necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such
reports;
(C) shall set forth adequate assurances that, with re-
spect to so much of any loan insured under the loan insur-
ance program as may be guaranteed by the Secretary pur-
suant to this subsection, the undertaking of the Secretary
under the guaranty agreement is acceptable in full satis-
faction of State law or regulation requiring the mainte-
nance of a reserve;
(D) shall provide that if, after the Secretary has made
payment under the guaranty agreement pursuant to para-
graph (1) of this subsection with respect to any loan, any
payments are made in discharge of the obligation incurred
by the borrower with respect to such loan (including any
payments of interest accruing on such loan after such pay-
ment by the Secretary), there shall be paid over to the Sec-
retary (for deposit in the fund established by section 431)
such proportion of the amounts of such payments as is de-
termined (in accordance with paragraph (6)(A)) to rep-
resent his equitable share thereof, but (i) shall provide for
subrogation of the United States to the rights of any insur-
ance beneficiary only to the extent required for the pur-
pose of paragraph (8); and (ii) except as the Secretary may
otherwise by or pursuant to regulation provide, amounts
so paid by a borrower on such a loan shall be first applied
in reduction of principal owing on such loan;

equal to each payment made under paragraph (1) will be
promptly deposited in or credited to the accounts main-
tained for the purpose of section 422(c);
(F) set forth adequate assurances that the guaranty
agency will not engage in any pattern or practice which re-
sults in a denial of a borrower’s access to loans under this
part because of the borrower’s race, sex, color, religion, na-
tional origin, age, handicapped status, income, attendance
at a particular eligible institution within the area served
by the guaranty agency, length of the borrower’s edu-
cational program, or the borrower’s academic year in
school;
(G) shall prohibit the Secretary from making any re-
imbursement under this subsection to a guaranty agency
when a default claim is based on an inability to locate the
borrower, unless the guaranty agency, at the time of filing
for reimbursement, certifies to the Secretary that diligent
attempts, including contact with the institution, have been
made to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable
skip-tracing techniques in accordance with regulations pre-
scribed by the Secretary; and
(H) set forth assurances that—
(i) upon the request of an eligible institution, the
guaranty agency shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii),
furnish to the institution information with respect to

students) who received loans made, insured, or guar-
anteed under this part for attendance at the eligible
institution and for whom default aversion assistance
activities have been requested under subsection (l);
(ii) the guaranty agency shall not require the pay-
ment from the institution of any fee for such informa-

student loans and shall prohibit the institution from
disseminating the information for any other purpose.

essary to promote the purpose of this part.
(3) FORBEARANCE.—A guaranty agreement under this sub-
section—

lender—
(I) under clause (i)(I) shall equal the length of
time remaining in the borrower’s medical or den-
tal internship or residency program, if the bor-
rower is not eligible to receive a deferment de-
scribed in such clause, or such length of time re-
maining in the program after the borrower has ex-
hausted the borrower’s eligibility for such
deferment;
(II) under clause (i)(II) or (IV) shall not exceed
3 years; or
(III) under clause (i)(III) shall not exceed the

rower forbearance, provide information to the bor-
rower to assist the borrower in understanding the im-

to consolidate loans, in order to collect or process ap-
propriate supporting documentation related to the re-
quest, and
(ii) during such period interest shall accrue but
not be capitalized.
Guaranty agencies shall not be precluded from permitting the
parties to such a loan from entering into a forbearance agree-
ment solely because the loan is in default. The Secretary shall
permit lenders to exercise administrative forbearances that do
not require the agreement of the borrower, under conditions
authorized by the Secretary. Such forbearances shall include (i)

anty agency begins to actively carry on a student loan in-

ceeding fiscal years,

agency in discharge of its insurance obligation insured under

ations of those guaranty agencies to which the provisions of

retary determines that the administrative or financial condi-

retary shall assume responsibility for all functions of the guar-
anty agency under the loan insurance program of such agency.
In performing such functions the Secretary is authorized to—

anty agency;
(ii) revoke the reinsurance agreement of the guaranty
agency at a specified date, so as to require the merger,
consolidation, or termination of the guaranty agency;

(i) 16 MULTIPLE DISBURSEMENT OF LOANS.—
(1) ESCROW ACCOUNTS ADMINISTERED BY ESCROW AGENT.—
Any guaranty agency or eligible lender (hereafter in this sub-
section referred to as the ‘‘escrow agent’’) may enter into an
agreement with any other eligible lender that is not an eligible
institution or an agency or instrumentality of the State (here-
after in this subsection referred to as the ‘‘lender’’) for the pur-
pose of authorizing disbursements of the proceeds of a loan to
a student. Such agreement shall provide that the lender will
pay the proceeds of such loans into an escrow account to be ad-
ministered by the escrow agent in accordance with the provi-
sions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such agreement may
allow the lender to make payments into the escrow account in
amounts that do not exceed the sum of the amounts required

the Federal Government or obligations which are insured
or guaranteed by the Federal Government;

ment; and

student ceases to carry at an eligible institution at least
one-half of the normal full-time academic workload as de-
termined by the institution.
(j) LENDERS-OF-LAST-RESORT.—
(1) GENERAL REQUIREMENT.—In each State, the guaranty
agency or an eligible lender in the State described in section
435(d)(1)(D) of this Act shall, before July 1, 2010, make loans
directly, or through an agreement with an eligible lender or
lenders, to eligible students and parents who are otherwise un-
able to obtain loans under this part (except for consolidation
loans under section 428C) or who attend an institution of high-
er education in the State that is designated under paragraph
(4). Loans made under this subsection shall not exceed the
amount of the need of the borrower, as determined under sub-
section (a)(2)(B), nor be less than $200. No loan under section
428, 428B, or 428H that is made pursuant to this subsection
shall be made with interest rates, origination or default fees,
or other terms and conditions that are more favorable to the
borrower than the maximum interest rates, origination or de-
fault fees, or other terms and conditions applicable to that type
of loan under this part. The guaranty agency shall consider the
request of any eligible lender, as defined under section
435(d)(1)(A) of this Act, to serve as the lender-of-last-resort
pursuant to this subsection.
(2) RULES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES.—The guaranty
agency shall develop rules and operating procedures for the
lender-of-last-resort program designed to ensure that—
(A) the program establishes operating hours and meth-
ods of application designed to facilitate application by stu-
dents and ensure a response within 60 days after the stu-
dent’s original complete application is filed under this sub-
section;
(B) consistent with standards established by the Sec-
retary, students applying for loans under this subsection
shall not be subject to additional eligibility requirements
or requests for additional information beyond what is re-
quired under this title in order to receive a loan under this
part from an eligible lender, nor, in the case of students
and parents applying for loans under this subsection be-
cause of an inability to otherwise obtain loans under this
part (except for consolidation loans under section 428C), be
required to receive more than two rejections from eligible
lenders in order to obtain a loan under this subsection;
(C) information about the availability of loans under
the program is made available to institutions of higher
education in the State; and

(D) appropriate steps are taken to ensure that bor-
rowers receiving loans under the program are appro-
priately counseled on their loan obligation.
(3) ADVANCES TO GUARANTY AGENCIES FOR LENDER-OF-
LAST-RESORT SERVICES.—(A) In order to ensure the availability
of loan capital, the Secretary is authorized to provide a guar-
anty agency designated for a State with additional advance
funds in accordance with subparagraph (C) and section
422(c)(7), with such restrictions on the use of such funds as are
determined appropriate by the Secretary, in order to ensure
that the guaranty agency will make loans as the lender-of-last-
resort. Such agency shall make such loans in accordance with
this subsection and the requirements of the Secretary.
(B) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, a
guaranty agency serving as a lender-of-last-resort under this
paragraph shall be paid a fee, established by the Secretary, for
making such loans in lieu of interest and special allowance
subsidies, and shall be required to assign such loans to the
Secretary on demand. Upon such assignment, the portion of
the advance represented by the loans assigned shall be consid-
ered repaid by such guaranty agency.
(C) The Secretary shall exercise the authority described in
subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary determines that eligible
borrowers are seeking and are unable to obtain loans under
this part or designates an institution of higher education for
participation in the program under this subsection under para-
graph (4), and that the guaranty agency designated for that
State has the capability to provide lender-of-last-resort loans in
a timely manner, in accordance with the guaranty agency’s ob-
ligations under paragraph (1), but cannot do so without ad-
vances provided by the Secretary under this paragraph. If the
Secretary makes the determinations described in the preceding
sentence and determines that it would be cost-effective to do
so, the Secretary may provide advances under this paragraph
to such guaranty agency. If the Secretary determines that such
guaranty agency does not have such capability, or will not pro-
vide such loans in a timely fashion, the Secretary may provide
such advances to enable another guaranty agency, that the
Secretary determines to have such capability, to make lender-
of-last-resort loans to eligible borrowers in that State who are
experiencing loan access problems or to eligible borrowers who
attend an institution in the State that is designated under
paragraph (4).
(4) INSTITUTION-WIDE STUDENT QUALIFICATION.—Upon the
request of an institution of higher education and pursuant to
standards developed by the Secretary, the Secretary shall des-
ignate such institution for participation in the lender-of-last-re-
sort program under this paragraph. If the Secretary designates
an institution under this paragraph, the guaranty agency des-
ignated for the State in which the institution is located shall
make loans, in the same manner as such loans are made under
paragraph (1), to students and parent borrowers of the des-
ignated institution, regardless of whether the students or par-

ent borrowers are otherwise unable to obtain loans under this
part (other than a consolidation loan under section 428C).
(5) STANDARDS DEVELOPED BY THE SECRETARY.—In devel-
oping standards with respect to paragraph (4), the Secretary
may require—
(A) an institution of higher education to demonstrate
that, despite due diligence on the part of the institution,
the institution has been unable to secure the commitment
of eligible lenders willing to make loans under this part to
a significant number of students attending the institution;
(B) that, prior to making a request under such para-
graph for designation for participation in the lender-of-
last-resort program, an institution of higher education
shall demonstrate that the institution has met a minimum
threshold, as determined by the Secretary, for the number
or percentage of students at such institution who have re-
ceived rejections from eligible lenders for loans under this
part; and
(C) any other standards and guidelines the Secretary
determines to be appropriate.
(6) EXPIRATION OF AUTHORITY.—The Secretary’s authority
under paragraph (4) to designate institutions of higher edu-
cation for participation in the program under this subsection
shall expire on June 30, 2010.
(7) EXPIRATION OF DESIGNATION.—The eligibility of an in-
stitution of higher education, or borrowers from such institu-
tion, to participate in the program under this subsection pursu-
ant to a designation of the institution by the Secretary under
paragraph (4) shall expire on June 30, 2010. After such date,
borrowers from an institution designated under paragraph (4)
shall be eligible to participate in the program under this sub-
section as such program existed on the day before the date of
enactment of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans
Act of 2008.
(8) PROHIBITION ON INDUCEMENTS AND MARKETING.—Each
guaranty agency or eligible lender that serves as a lender-of-
last-resort under this subsection—
(A) shall be subject to the prohibitions on inducements
contained in subsection (b)(3) and the requirements of sec-
tion 435(d)(5); and
(B) shall not advertise, market, or otherwise promote
loans under this subsection, except that nothing in this
paragraph shall prohibit a guaranty agency from fulfilling
its responsibilities under paragraph (2)(C).

(i) broadly disseminate information regarding the
availability of loans made under this subsection;

ant to paragraph (4), or payments related to such loans,

to notify eligible institutions of former students who are in de-
fault of their continuing obligation to repay student loans, each

tion, furnish information with respect to students who were en-
rolled at the eligible institution and who are in default on the

this part. The information authorized to be furnished under

in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a
consequence of section 427A(c)(4).
(e) REFINANCING.—
(1) REFINANCING TO SECURE COMBINED PAYMENT.—An eli-
gible lender may at any time consolidate loans held by it which
are made under this section to a borrower, including loans
which were made under section 428B as in effect prior to the
enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1986,
under a single repayment schedule which provides for a single
principal payment and a single payment of interest, and shall
calculate the repayment period for each included loan from the
date of the commencement of repayment of the most recent in-
cluded loan. Unless the consolidated loan is obtained by a bor-
rower who is electing to obtain variable interest under para-
graph (2) or (3), such consolidated loan shall bear interest at
the weighted average of the rates of all included loans. The ex-
tension of any repayment period of an included loan pursuant
to this paragraph shall be reported (if required by them) to the
Secretary or guaranty agency insuring the loan, as the case
may be, but no additional insurance premiums shall be pay-
able with respect to any such extension. The extension of the
repayment period of any included loan shall not require the
formal extension of the promissory note evidencing the in-
cluded loan or the execution of a new promissory note, but
shall be treated as an administrative forbearance of the repay-
ment terms of the included loan.
(2) REFINANCING TO SECURE VARIABLE INTEREST RATE.—An
eligible lender may reissue a loan which was made under this
section before July 1, 1987, or under section 428B as in effect
prior to the enactment of the Higher Education Amendments
of 1986 in order to permit the borrower to obtain the interest
rate provided under section 427A(c)(4). A lender offering to re-
issue a loan or loans for such purpose may charge a borrower
an amount not to exceed $100 to cover the administrative costs
of reissuing such loan or loans, not more than one-half of
which shall be paid to the guarantor of the loan being reissued
to cover costs of reissuance. Reissuance of a loan under this
paragraph shall not affect any insurance applicable with re-
spect to the loan, and no additional insurance fee may be
charged to the borrower with respect to the loan.
(3) R EFINANCING BY DISCHARGE OF PREVIOUS LOAN.—A bor-
rower who has applied to an original lender for reissuance of
a loan under paragraph (2) and who is denied such reissuance
may obtain a loan from another lender for the purpose of dis-
charging the loan from such original lender. A loan made for
such purpose—
(A) shall bear interest at the applicable rate of interest
provided under section 427A(c)(4);
(B) shall not result in the extension of the duration of
the note (other than as permitted under subsection
(d)(5)(B));
(C) may be subject to an additional insurance fee but
shall not be subject to the administrative cost charge per-
mitted by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and

TATION.—Each new lender may accept certification from the
original lender of the borrower’s original loan in lieu of presen-
tation of the original promissory note.
(f) V ERIFICATION OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AND SOCIAL
SECURITY NUMBER.—A parent who wishes to borrow funds under
this section shall be subject to verification of the parent’s—
(1) immigration status in the same manner as immigration
status is verified for students under section 484(g); and
(2) social security number in the same manner as social se-
curity numbers are verified for students under section 484(o).

SEC. 429. ø20 U.S.C. 1079¿ CERTIFICATE OF FEDERAL LOAN INSUR-
ANCE—EFFECTIVE DATE OF INSURANCE.
(a) LOAN-BY-LOAN INSURANCE.—
(1) AUTHORITY TO ISSUE CERTIFICATES ON APPLICATION.—If,
upon application by an eligible lender, made upon such form,
containing such information, and supported by such evidence
as the Secretary may require, and otherwise in conformity with
this section, the Secretary finds that the applicant has made
a loan to an eligible student which is insurable under the pro-
visions of this part, he may issue to the applicant a certificate
of insurance covering the loan and setting forth the amount
and terms of the insurance.
(2) EFFECTIVENESS OF CERTIFICATE.—Insurance evidenced
by a certificate of insurance pursuant to subsection (a)(1) shall
become effective upon the date of issuance of the certificate, ex-
cept that the Secretary is authorized, in accordance with regu-
lations, to issue commitments with respect to proposed loans,
or with respect to lines (or proposed lines) of credit, submitted
by eligible lenders, and in that event, upon compliance with

subsection (a)(1) by the lender, the certificate of insurance may
be issued effective as of the date when any loan, or any pay-
ment by the lender pursuant to a line of credit, to be covered
by such insurance was made. Such insurance shall cease to be
effective upon 60 days’ default by the lender in the payment
of any installment of the premiums payable pursuant to sub-
section (c).
(3) CONTENTS OF APPLICATIONS.—An application submitted
pursuant to subsection (a)(1) shall contain (A) an agreement by
the applicant to pay, in accordance with regulations, the pre-
miums fixed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c), and
(B) an agreement by the applicant that if the loan is covered
by insurance the applicant will submit such supplementary re-
ports and statement during the effective period of the loan
agreement, upon such forms, at such times, and containing
such information as the Secretary may prescribe by or pursu-
ant to regulation.
(b) COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE COVERAGE CERTIFICATE.—
(1) ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEM BY REGULATION.—In lieu of
requiring a separate insurance application and issuing a sepa-
rate certificate of insurance for each student loan made by an
eligible lender as provided in subsection (a), the Secretary may,
in accordance with regulations consistent with section 424,
issue to any eligible lender applying therefor a certificate of
comprehensive insurance coverage which shall, without further
action by the Secretary, insure all insurable loans made by
that lender, on or after the date of the certificate and before
a specified cutoff date, within the limits of an aggregate max-
imum amount stated in the certificate. Such regulations may
provide for conditioning such insurance, with respect to any
loan, upon compliance by the lender with such requirements
(to be stated or incorporated by reference in the certificate) as
in the Secretary’s judgment will best achieve the purpose of
this subsection while protecting the United States from the
risk of unreasonable loss and promoting the objectives of this
part, including (but not limited to) provisions as to the report-
ing of such loans and information relevant thereto to the Sec-
retary and as to the payment of initial and other premiums
and the effect of default therein, and including provision for
confirmation by the Secretary from time to time (through en-
dorsement of the certificate) of the coverage of specific new
loans by such certificate, which confirmation shall be incontest-
able by the Secretary in the absence of fraud or misrepresenta-
tion of fact or patent error.
(2) UNCOVERED LOANS.—If the holder of a certificate of
comprehensive insurance coverage issued under this subsection
grants to a student a line of credit extending beyond the cutoff
date specified in that certificate, loans or payments thereon
made by the holder after that date pursuant to the line of cred-
it shall not be deemed to be included in the coverage of that
certificate except as may be specifically provided therein; but,
subject to the limitations of section 424, the Secretary may, in
accordance with regulations, make commitments to insure such
future loans or payments, and such commitments may be hon-

ored either as provided in subsection (a) or by inclusion of such
insurance on comprehensive coverage under the subsection for
the period or periods in which such future loans or payments
are made.
(c) CHARGES FOR FEDERAL INSURANCE.—The Secretary shall,
pursuant to regulations, charge for insurance on each loan under
this part a premium in an amount not to exceed one-fourth of 1
percent per year of the unpaid principal amount of such loan (ex-
cluding interest added to principal), payable in advance, at such
times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary.
Such regulations may provide that such premium shall not be pay-
able, or if paid shall be refundable, with respect to any period after
default in the payment of principal or interest or after the borrower
has died or becomes totally and permanently disabled, if (1) notice
of such default or other event has been duly given, and (2) requests
for payment of the loss insured against has been made or the Sec-
retary has made such payment on his own motion pursuant to sec-
tion 430(a).
(d) ASSIGNABILITY OF I NSURANCE.—The rights of an eligible
lender arising under insurance evidenced by a certificate of insur-
ance issued to it under this section may be assigned as security by
such lender only to another eligible lender, and subject to regula-
tion by the Secretary.
(e) CONSOLIDATION NOT TO AFFECT INSURANCE.—The consoli-
dation of the obligations of two or more federally insured loans ob-
tained by a student borrower in any fiscal year into a single obliga-
tion evidenced by a single instrument of indebtedness shall not af-
fect the insurance by the United States. If the loans thus consoli-
dated are covered by separate certificates of insurance issued under
subsection (a), the Secretary may upon surrender of the original
certificates issue a new certificate of insurance in accordance with
that subsection upon the consolidated obligation; if they are cov-
ered by a single comprehensive certificate issued under subsection
(b), the Secretary may amend that certificate accordingly.
SEC. 430. ø20 U.S.C. 1080¿ DEFAULT OF STUDENT UNDER FEDERAL
LOAN INSURANCE PROGRAM.
(a) NOTICE TO SECRETARY AND PAYMENT OF LOSS.—Upon de-
fault by the student borrower on any loan covered by Federal loan
insurance pursuant to this part, and prior to the commencement of
suit or other enforcement proceedings upon security for that loan,
the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the Secretary, and
the Secretary shall if requested (at that time or after further collec-
tion efforts) by the beneficiary, or may on the Secretary’s own mo-
tion, if the insurance is still in effect, pay to the beneficiary the
amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan as soon
as that amount has been determined. The ‘‘amount of the loss’’ on
any loan shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection
(b), be deemed to be an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the
principal amount and accrued interest, including interest accruing
from the date of submission of a valid default claim (as determined
by the Secretary) to the date on which payment is authorized by
the Secretary, reduced to the extent required by section 425(b).
Such beneficiary shall be required to meet the standards of due
diligence in the collection of the loan and shall be required to sub-

mit proof that the institution was contacted and other reasonable
attempts were made to locate the borrower (when the location of
the borrower is unknown) and proof that contact was made with
the borrower (when the location is known). The Secretary shall
make the determination required to carry out the provisions of this
section not later than 90 days after the notification by the insur-
ance beneficiary and shall make payment in full on the amount of
the beneficiary’s loss pending completion of the due diligence inves-
tigation.
(b) EFFECT OF PAYMENT OF LOSS.—Upon payment of the
amount of the loss pursuant to subsection (a), the United States
shall be subrogated for all of the rights of the holder of the obliga-
tion upon the insured loan and shall be entitled to an assignment
of the note or other evidence of the insured loan by the insurance
beneficiary. If the net recovery made by the Secretary on a loan
after deduction of the cost of that recovery (including reasonable
administrative costs and collection costs, to the extent set forth in
regulations issued by the Secretary) exceeds the amount of the loss,
the excess shall be paid over to the insured. The Secretary may,
in attempting to make recovery on such loans, contract with pri-
vate business concerns, State student loan insurance agencies, or
State guaranty agencies, for payment for services rendered by such
concerns or agencies in assisting the Secretary in making such re-
covery. Any contract under this subsection entered into by the Sec-
retary shall provide that attempts to make recovery on such loans
shall be fair and reasonable, and do not involve harassment, in-
timidation, false or misleading representations, or unnecessary
communications concerning the existence of any such loan to per-
sons other than the student borrower.
(c) FORBEARANCE NOT PRECLUDED.—Nothing in this section or
in this part shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the
benefit of the student borrower which may be agreed upon by the
parties to the insured loan and approved by the Secretary, or to
preclude forbearance by the Secretary in the enforcement of the in-
sured obligation after payment on that insurance. Any forbearance
which is approved by the Secretary under this subsection with re-
spect to the repayment of a loan, including a forbearance during
default, shall not be considered as indicating that a holder of a fed-
erally insured loan has failed to exercise reasonable care and due
diligence in the collection of the loan.
(d) CARE AND DILIGENCE REQUIRED OF HOLDERS.—Nothing in
this section or in this part shall be construed to excuse the holder
of a federally insured loan from exercising reasonable care and dili-
gence in the making and collection of loans under the provisions of
this part. If the Secretary, after a reasonable notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing to an eligible lender, finds that it has substan-
tially failed to exercise such care and diligence or to make the re-
ports and statements required under section 428(a)(4) and section
429(a)(3), or to pay the required Federal loan insurance premiums,
the Secretary shall disqualify that lender for further Federal insur-
ance on loans granted pursuant to this part until the Secretary is
satisfied that its failure has ceased and finds that there is reason-
able assurance that the lender will in the future exercise necessary

list indicating the cohort default rate (determined in accord-
ance with section 435(m)) for each originating lender, subse-
quent holder, and guaranty agency participating in the pro-
gram assisted under this part and an average cohort default
rate for all institutions of higher education within each State.
(2) REGULATIONS.—The Secretary shall prescribe regula-
tions designed to prevent an institution from evading the appli-
cation to that institution of a cohort default rate through the
use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of
ownership or control, or any similar device.
(3) RATE ESTABLISHMENT AND CORRECTION.—The Secretary
shall establish a cohort default rate for lenders, holders, and
guaranty agencies (determined consistent with section 435(m)),
except that the rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies
shall not reflect any loans issued in accordance with section
428(j).The Secretary shall allow institutions, lenders, holders,
and guaranty agencies the opportunity to correct such cohort
default rate information.
SEC. 430A. ø20 U.S.C. 1080A¿ REPORTS TO CONSUMER REPORTING

pose of promoting responsible repayment of loans covered by Fed-
eral loan insurance pursuant to this part or covered by a guaranty
agreement pursuant to section 428, the Secretary and each guar-
anty agency, eligible lender, and subsequent holder shall enter into
an agreement with each consumer reporting agency to exchange in-
formation concerning student borrowers, in accordance with the re-
quirements of this section. For the purpose of assisting such con-
sumer reporting agencies in complying with the Fair Credit Report-
ing Act, such agreements may provide for timely response by the
Secretary (concerning loans covered by Federal loan insurance) or
by a guaranty agency, eligible lender, or subsequent holder (con-
cerning loans covered by a guaranty agreement), or to requests
from such consumer reporting agencies for responses to objections
raised by borrowers. Subject to the requirements of subsection (c),
such agreements shall require the Secretary or the guaranty agen-
cy, eligible lender, or subsequent holder, as appropriate, to disclose

(2) the total amount of loans made to any borrower under
this part and the remaining balance of the loans;
(3) information concerning the repayment status of the

such information, or any objections by the borrower with re-
spect to any such information, as required by section 611 of the
Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681i);
(3) no use will be made of any such information which
would result in the use of collection practices with respect to

retary for making payments in connection with the default of loans
insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with

ations under this part, any excess advances under section 422, and

(2) LIMITATIONS.—No civil penalty may be imposed under

volved.
(4) CONSIDERATION AS SINGLE VIOLATION.—For the purpose
of paragraph (1) of this subsection, violations, failures, or sub-
stantial misrepresentations arising from a specific practice of
a lender or guaranty agency, and occurring prior to notification
by the Secretary under that paragraph, shall be deemed to be
a single violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation
even if the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation
affects more than one loan or more than one borrower, or both.
The Secretary may only impose a single civil penalty for each
such violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation.
(5) ASSIGNEES NOT LIABLE FOR VIOLATIONS BY OTHERS.—If
a loan affected by a violation, failure, or substantial misrepre-
sentation is assigned to another holder, the lender or guaranty
agency responsible for the violation, failure, or substantial mis-
representation shall remain liable for any civil money penalty
provided for under paragraph (1) of this subsection, but the as-
signee shall not be liable for any such civil money penalty.

ney General, any civil penalty under paragraph (1) of this sub-

compromise, the Secretary shall consider the appropriateness
of the penalty to the resources of the lender or guaranty agen-
cy subject to the determination; the gravity of the violation,
failure, or substantial misrepresentation; the frequency and
persistence of the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresen-
tation; and the amount of any losses resulting from the viola-
tion, failure, or substantial misrepresentation. The amount of
such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed
upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by
the United States to the lender or agency charged, unless the
lender or agency has, in the case of a final agency determina-
tion, commenced proceedings for judicial review within 90 days
of the determination, in which case the deduction may not be
made during the pendency of the proceeding.

available high-quality educational programs and materials to pro-
vide training for students and families in budgeting and financial

term ‘‘eligible institution’’ means an institution of higher edu-
cation, as defined in section 102, except that, for the purposes
of sections 427(a)(2)(C)(i) and 428(b)(1)(M)(i), an eligible insti-

gible for participation in any program under this part pursuant
to paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(2) INELIGIBILITY BASED ON HIGH DEFAULT RATES.—(A) An
institution whose cohort default rate is equal to or greater than
the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for each
of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are avail-
able shall not be eligible to participate in a program under this
part for the fiscal year for which the determination is made
and for the two succeeding fiscal years, unless, within 30 days
of receiving notification from the Secretary of the loss of eligi-
bility under this paragraph, the institution appeals the loss of
its eligibility to the Secretary. The Secretary shall issue a deci-
sion on any such appeal within 45 days after its submission.
Such decision may permit the institution to continue to partici-
pate in a program under this part if—
(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of
the Secretary that the Secretary’s calculation of its cohort
default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would
reduce its cohort default rate for any of the three fiscal
years below the threshold percentage specified in subpara-
graph (B);
(ii) there are exceptional mitigating circumstances
within the meaning of paragraph (5); or
(iii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, other
exceptional mitigating circumstances that would make the
application of this paragraph inequitable.
If an institution continues to participate in a program under
this part, and the institution’s appeal of the loss of eligibility
is unsuccessful, the institution shall be required to pay to the
Secretary an amount equal to the amount of interest, special
allowance, reinsurance, and any related payments made by the
Secretary (or which the Secretary is obligated to make) with
respect to loans made under this part to students attending, or
planning to attend, that institution during the pendency of
such appeal. During such appeal, the Secretary may permit the
institution to continue to participate in a program under this
part.
(B) For purposes of determinations under subparagraph
(A), the threshold percentage is—
(i) 35 percent for fiscal year 1991 and 1992;
(ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993;
(iii) 23 25 percent for fiscal year 1994 through fis-
cal year 2011; and
(iv) 23 30 percent for fiscal year 2012 and any suc-
ceeding fiscal year.
(C) Until July 1, 1999, this paragraph shall not apply to
any institution that is—
(i) a part B institution within the meaning of section
322(2) of this Act;
(ii) a tribally controlled college or university, as de-
fined in section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Colleges
and Universities Assistance Act of 1978; or

Community College Act.
(D) 24 Notwithstanding the first sentence of subparagraph (A),
the Secretary shall restore the eligibility to participate in a pro-
gram under subpart 1 of part A, part B, or part D of an institution
that did not appeal its loss of eligibility within 30 days of receiving
notification if the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis,
that the institution’s failure to appeal was substantially justified
under the circumstances, and that—
(i) the institution made a timely request that the appro-
priate guaranty agency correct errors in the draft data used to
calculate the institution’s cohort default rate;
(ii) the guaranty agency did not correct the erroneous data
in a timely fashion; and
(iii) the institution would have been eligible if the erro-
neous data had been corrected by the guaranty agency.
(3) APPEALS FOR REGULATORY RELIEF.—An institution
whose cohort default rate, calculated in accordance with sub-
section (m), is equal to or greater than the threshold percent-
age specified in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) for any two consecutive
fiscal years may, not later than 30 days after the date the in-
stitution receives notification from the Secretary, file an appeal
demonstrating exceptional mitigating circumstances, as defined
in paragraph (5). The Secretary shall issue a decision on any
such appeal not later than 45 days after the date of submission
of the appeal. If the Secretary determines that the institution
demonstrates exceptional mitigating circumstances, the Sec-
retary may not subject the institution to provisional certifi-
cation based solely on the institution’s cohort default rate.
(4) A PPEALS BASED UPON ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER LOAN
SERVICING.—An institution that—
(A) is subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Fam-
ily Education Loan Program pursuant to paragraph (2)(A)
of this subsection;
(B) is subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Sup-
plemental Loans for Students pursuant to section
428A(a)(2); or
(C) is an institution whose cohort default rate equals
or exceeds 20 percent for the most recent year for which
data are available;
may include in its appeal of such loss or rate a defense based

(5) DEFINITION OF MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES.—(A) For
purposes of this subsection, an institution of higher education
shall be treated as having exceptional mitigating cir-
cumstances that make application of paragraph (2) inequitable,
and that provide for regulatory relief under paragraph (3), if
such institution, in the opinion of an independent auditor,
meets the following criteria:
(i) For a 12-month period that ended during the 6
months immediately preceding the fiscal year for which
the cohort of borrowers used to calculate the institution’s
cohort default rate is determined, at least two-thirds of the
students enrolled on at least a half-time basis at the insti-
tution— (I) are eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant
award that is at least equal to one-half the Federal
Pell Grant amount, determined under section
401(b)(2)(A), for which a student would be eligible
based on the student’s enrollment status; or
(II) have an adjusted gross income that when
added with the adjusted gross income of the student’s
parents (unless the student is an independent stu-
dent), of less than the poverty level, as determined by
the Department of Health and Human Services.
(ii) In the case of an institution of higher education
that offers an associate, baccalaureate, graduate or profes-
sional degree, 70 percent or more of the institution’s reg-
ular students who were initially enrolled on a full-time
basis and were scheduled to complete their programs dur-
ing the same 12-month period described in clause (i)—
(I) completed the educational programs in which
the students were enrolled;
(II) transferred from the institution to a higher
level educational program;
(III) at the end of the 12-month period, remained
enrolled and making satisfactory progress toward com-
pletion of the student’s educational programs; or
(IV) entered active duty in the Armed Forces of
the United States.
(iii)(I) In the case of an institution of higher education
that does not award a degree described in clause (ii), had
a placement rate of 44 percent or more with respect to the
institution’s former regular students who—
(aa) remained in the program beyond the point
the students would have received a 100 percent tuition
refund from the institution;
(bb) were initially enrolled on at least a half-time
basis; and
(cc) were originally scheduled, at the time of en-
rollment, to complete their educational programs dur-
ing the same 12-month period described in clause (i).
(II) The placement rate shall not include students who
are still enrolled and making satisfactory progress in the

educational programs in which the students were origi-
nally enrolled on the date following 12 months after the
date of the student’s last date of attendance at the institu-
tion.(III) The placement rate is calculated by determining
the percentage of all those former regular students who—
(aa) are employed, in an occupation for which the
institution provided training, on the date following 12
months after the date of their last day of attendance
at the institution;
(bb) were employed, in an occupation for which
the institution provided training, for at least 13 weeks
before the date following 12 months after the date of
their last day of attendance at the institution; or
(cc) entered active duty in the Armed Forces of the
United States.
(IV) The placement rate shall not include as place-
ments a student or former student for whom the institu-
tion is the employer.
(B) For purposes of determining a rate of completion and
a placement rate under this paragraph, a student is originally
scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete the edu-
cational program on the date when the student will have been
enrolled in the program for the amount of time normally re-
quired to complete the program. The amount of time normally
required to complete the program for a student who is initially
enrolled full-time is the period of time specified in the institu-
tion’s enrollment contract, catalog, or other materials, for com-
pletion of the program by a full-time student. For a student
who is initially enrolled less than full-time, the period is the
amount of time it would take the student to complete the pro-
gram if the student remained enrolled at that level of enroll-
ment throughout the program.
(6) REDUCTION OF DEFAULT RATES AT CERTAIN MINORITY IN-
STITUTIONS.—
(A) BENEFICIARIES OF EXCEPTION REQUIRED TO ESTAB-
LISH MANAGEMENT PLAN.—After July 1, 1999, any institu-

tion shall—
(i) submit to the Secretary a default management
plan which the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion,
after consideration of the institution’s history, re-
sources, dollars in default, and targets for default re-
duction, determines is acceptable and provides reason-
able assurance that the institution will, by July 1,
2004, have a cohort default rate that is less than 25
percent;
(ii) engage an independent third party (which may
be paid with funds received under section 317 or part
B of title III) to provide technical assistance in imple-
menting such default management plan; and

tensive and forceful as those generally practiced by financial insti-
tutions for the collection of consumer loans.
(i) 28 HOLDER.—The term ‘‘holder’’ means an eligible lender
who owns a loan.

ments, or (2) 330 days in the case of a loan which is repayable in
less frequent installments. 29
(m) COHORT DEFAULT RATE.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2),
the term ‘‘cohort default rate’’ means, for any fiscal year in
which 30 or more current and former students at the institu-
tion enter repayment on loans under section 428, 428A, or
428H, received for attendance at the institution, the percent-
age of those current and former students who enter repayment
on such loans (or on the portion of a loan made under section
428C that is used to repay any such loans) received for attend-
ance at that institution in that fiscal year who default before
the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in
which the students entered repayment. The Secretary shall re-
quire that each guaranty agency that has insured loans for
current or former students of the institution afford such insti-
tution a reasonable opportunity (as specified by the Secretary)
to review and correct errors in the information required to be
provided to the Secretary by the guaranty agency for the pur-
poses of calculating a cohort default rate for such institution,
prior to the calculation of such rate.
(B) In determining the number of students who default be-
fore the end of such second fiscal year, the Secretary shall in-
clude only loans for which the Secretary or a guaranty agency
has paid claims for insurance. In considering appeals with re-
spect to cohort default rates pursuant to subsection (a)(3), the
Secretary shall exclude, from the calculation of the number of
students who entered repayment and from the calculation of
the number of students who default, any loans which, due to
improper servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the

tion of such cohort default rate.
(C) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the insti-
tution’s current and former students enter repayment, the
term ‘‘cohort default rate’’ means the percentage of such cur-
rent and former students who entered repayment on such
loans (or on the portion of a loan made under section 428C
that is used to repay any such loans) in any of the three most
recent fiscal years, who default before the end of the second fis-
cal year following the year in which they entered repayment.
(2) SPECIAL RULES.—(A) In the case of a student who has
attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student
(and such student’s subsequent repayment or default) is attrib-
uted to each school for attendance at which the student re-
ceived a loan that entered repayment in the fiscal year.
(B) A loan on which a payment is made by the school, such
school’s owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other entity
or individual affiliated with such school, in order to avoid de-
fault by the borrower, is considered as in default for purposes
of this subsection.
(C) Any loan which has been rehabilitated before the end
of the second fiscal year following the year in which the loan
entered repayment is not considered as in default for purposes
of this subsection. The Secretary may require guaranty agen-
cies to collect data with respect to defaulted loans in a manner
that will permit the identification of any defaulted loan for
which (i) the borrower is currently making payments and has
made not less than 6 consecutive on-time payments by the end
of such second fiscal year, and (ii) a guaranty agency has re-
newed the borrower’s title IV eligibility as provided in section
428F(b).
(D) For the purposes of this subsection, a loan made in ac-
cordance with section 428A (or the portion of a loan made
under section 428C that is used to repay a loan made under
section 428A) shall not be considered to enter repayment until
after the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in a course of
study leading to a degree or certificate at an eligible institution
on at least a half-time basis (as determined by the institution)
and ceased to be in a period of forbearance based on such en-
rollment. Each eligible lender of a loan made under section
428A (or a loan made under section 428C a portion of which
is used to repay a loan made under section 428A) shall provide
the guaranty agency with the information necessary to deter-
mine when the loan entered repayment for purposes of this
subsection, and the guaranty agency shall provide such infor-
mation to the Secretary.
(3) REGULATIONS TO PREVENT EVASIONS.—The Secretary
shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution
from evading the application to that institution of a default
rate determination under this subsection through the use of
such measures as branching, consolidation, change of owner-
ship or control, or any similar device.

year in which one or more current and former students at an
institution enter repayment on loans under section 428, 428B,

retary shall publish the percentage of those current and former
students who enter repayment on such loans (or on the portion
of a loan made under section 428C that is used to repay any
such loans) received for attendance at the institution in that
fiscal year who default before the end of each succeeding fiscal
year.
(B) The Secretary may designate such additional subcat-
egories within the categories specified in subparagraph (A) as

stitution or if such student’s eligibility to borrow under this
part was falsely certified by the eligible institution or was

rying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return

such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an im-
proved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the
special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, ex-
peditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the
determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.
(b) COMPUTATION AND PAYMENT.—

such 3-month period, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest
rate on such loans from such average, (iii) by adding 3.10 per-
cent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant
percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than
zero, such loans shall be subject to section 427A(i).

tively and permanently elects to waive all contrac-
tual, statutory, or other legal rights to a special
allowance paid under clause (vii) or to the special

allowance and interest benefits payments due the holder.
(B) Such daily interest shall be computed at the daily
equivalent rate of the sum of the special allowance rate com-
puted pursuant to paragraph (2) and the interest rate applica-
ble to the loan and shall be paid for the later of (i) the 31st
day after the receipt of such request for payment from the

ance, and the total amount of interest and special allowance
payable under section 428(a)(3)(A) and subsection (b) of this

section (b) of this section, to collect any origination fee or to

empt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to
be eligible to receive a special allowance under subsection (b)(2) on
any such loans, the Authority shall not engage in any pattern or
practice which results in a denial of a borrower’s access to loans
under this part because of the borrower’s race, sex, color, religion,
national origin, age, disability status, income, attendance at a par-
ticular eligible institution within the area served by the Authority,
length of the borrower’s educational program, or the borrower’s
academic year in school.

with regard to student loans which are not insured or guaran-
teed as provided for in this subsection as it may undertake
with regard to insured or guaranteed student loans. Any
warehousing advance made on the security of such loans shall
be subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection
to the same extent as a warehousing advance made on the se-
curity of insured loans.
(2) WAREHOUSING ADVANCES.—Any warehousing advance
made under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection shall be made
on the security of (A) insured loans, (B) marketable obligations
and securities issued, guaranteed, or insured by, the United
States, or for which the full faith and credit of the United
States is pledged for the repayment of principal and interest
thereof, or (C) marketable obligations issued, guaranteed, or
insured by any agency, instrumentality, or corporation of the
United States for which the credit of such agency, instrumen-
tality, or corporation is pledged for the repayment of principal
and interest thereof, in an amount equal to the amount of such
advance. The proceeds of any such advance secured by insured
loans shall either be invested in additional insured loans or the
lender shall provide assurances to the Association that during
the period of the borrowing it will maintain a level of insured
loans in its portfolio not less than the aggregate outstanding
balance of such loans held at the time of the borrowing. The
proceeds from any such advance secured by collateral described
in clauses (B) and (C) shall be invested in additional insured
student loans.
(3) PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTERESTS IN STUDENT
LOANS.—Notwithstanding the provisions of any State law to
the contrary, including the Uniform Commercial Code as in ef-
fect in any State, a security interest in insured student loans
created on behalf of the Association or any eligible lender as
defined in section 435(a) may be perfected either through the
taking of possession of such loans or by the filing of notice of
such security interest in such loans in the manner provided by
such State law for perfection of security interests in accounts.

quiring that, as a condition to the receipt of a loan, the student or
his family maintain a business relationship with the lender, except

Association or any holder. Each outstanding certificate for vot-
ing or nonvoting common stock shall evidence ownership of the

to be rights and obligations with respect to such converted
shares.

(h) DEBT OBLIGATIONS.—
(1) APPROVAL BY SECRETARIES OF EDUCATION AND THE
TREASURY.—The Association is authorized with the approval of
the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury
to issue and have outstanding obligations having such matu-
rities and bearing such rate or rates of interest as may be de-
termined by the Association. The authority of the Secretary of
Education to approve the issuance of such obligations is lim-
ited to obligations issued by the Association and guaranteed by
the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.
Such obligations may be redeemable at the option of the Asso-
ciation before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated
therein. The Secretary of the Treasury may not direct as a con-
dition of his approval that any such issuance of obligations by
the Association be made or sold to the Federal Financing
Bank. To the extent that the average outstanding amount of
the obligations owned by the Association pursuant to the au-
thority contained in subsection (d)(1) (B) and (C) of this section
and as to which the income is exempt from taxation under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 does not exceed the average

tions issued under this paragraph shall not be deemed to be
interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or
carry obligations for the purpose of section 265 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986.

sultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. Nothing in this
section shall be construed so as to authorize the Secretary of
Education or the Secretary of the Treasury to limit, control, or
constrain programs of the Association or support of the Guar-
anteed Student Loan Program by the Association.
(3) BORROWING AUTHORITY TO MEET GUARANTEE OBLIGA-
TIONS.—To enable the Secretary to discharge his responsibil-
ities under guarantees issued by him, he is authorized to issue
to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in
such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and
subject to such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by
the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a
rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into
consideration the current average market yield on outstanding
marketable obligations of the United States of comparable ma-
turities during the months preceding the issuance of the notes
or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is author-
ized and directed to purchase any notes and other obligations
issued hereunder and for that purpose he is authorized to use
as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any
securities issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act, as
amended, and the purposes for which securities may be issued
under that Act, as amended, are extended to include any pur-
chase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the
Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obliga-
tions acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions,
purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such
notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt trans-
actions of the United States. There is authorized to be appro-
priated to the Secretary such sums as may be necessary to pay
the principal and interest on the notes or obligations issued by
him to the Secretary of the Treasury.
(4) ACTION ON REQUEST FOR GUARANTEES.—Upon receipt of
a request from the Association under this subsection requiring
approvals by the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of the
Treasury shall act promptly either to grant approval or to ad-
vise the Association of the reasons for withholding approval. In
no case shall such an approval be withheld for a period longer
than 60 days unless, prior to the end of such period, the Sec-
retary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury submit
to the Congress a detailed explanation of reasons for doing so.
(5) AUTHORITY OF TREASURY TO PURCHASE DEBT.—The Sec-
retary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase any obliga-
tions issued by the Association pursuant to this subsection as
now or hereafter in force, and for such purpose the Secretary
of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt trans-
action the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter
issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act, as now or hereafter
in force, and the purposes for which securities may be issued
under the Second Liberty Bond Act, as now or hereafter in
force are extended to include such purchases. The Secretary of

the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations
under this subsection if such purchase would increase the ag-
gregate principal amount of his then outstanding holdings of
such obligations under this subsection to an amount greater
than $1,000,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Sec-
retary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon
such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate deter-
mined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consider-
ation the current average rate on outstanding marketable obli-
gations of the United States of comparable maturities as of the
last day of the month preceding the making of such purchase.
The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, sell, upon
such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as he
shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by him under
this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the
Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this sub-
section shall be treated as public debt transactions of the
United States.
(6) SALE OF DEBT TO FEDERAL FINANCING BANK.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law the Association is author-
ized to sell or issue obligations on the security of student loans,

been guaranteed under section 428 or 429 of this part, to the
Federal Financing Bank.

retary, on a monthly basis, an offset fee calculated on an an-
nual basis in an amount equal to 0.30 percent of the principal
amount of each loan made, insured or guaranteed under this
part that the Association holds (except for loans made pursu-
ant to sections 428C, 439(o), or 439(q)) and that was acquired
on or after the date of enactment of this paragraph.
(B) If the Secretary determines that the Association has
substantially failed to comply with subsection (q), subpara-
graph (A) shall be applied by substituting ‘‘1.0 percent’’ for ‘‘0.3
percent’’.

to this paragraph into the insurance fund established in sec-
tion 431.

porate name and through its own counsel;

pendent public accountants licensed to practice by such regulatory
authority after December 31, 1970, and persons who, although not
so certified or licensed, meet, in the opinion of the Secretary, stand-
ards of education and experience representative of the highest
standards prescribed by the licensing authorities of the several
States which provide for the continuing licensing of public account-
ants and which are prescribed by the Secretary in appropriate reg-
ulations may perform such audits until December 31, 1975. A re-
port of each such audit shall be furnished to the Secretary of the
Treasury. The audit shall be conducted at the place or places where
the accounts are normally kept. The representatives of the Sec-
retary shall have access to all books, accounts, financial records, re-
ports, files, and all other papers, things, or property belonging to
or in use by the Association and necessary to facilitate the audit,
and they shall be afforded full facilities for verifying transactions
with the balances or securities held by depositaries, fiscal agents,

ury to the President and to the Congress not later than 6 months

rect obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal or in-
terest by, the United States. The Association shall, for the purposes
of section 14(b)(2) of the Federal Reserve Act, be deemed to be an
agency of the United States. The obligations of the Association
shall be deemed to be obligations of the United States for the pur-
pose of section 3124 of title 31, United States Code. For the pur-
pose of the distribution of its property pursuant to section 726 of
title 11, United States Code, the Association shall be deemed a per-
son within the meaning of such title. The priority established in
favor of the United States by section 3713 of title 31, United States
Code, shall not establish a priority over the indebtedness of the As-
sociation issued or incurred on or before September 30, 1992. The

retary of the Treasury. The Association shall reimburse the Sec-
retary of the Treasury for any expenditures made in the prepara-

appropriate to effect, upon the shareholder approval described in
subsection (b), a restructuring of the common stock ownership of
the Association, as set forth in a plan of reorganization adopted by
the Board of Directors (the terms of which shall be consistent with
this section) so that all of the outstanding common shares of the
Association shall be directly owned by a Holding Company. Such
actions may include, in the Board of Director’s discretion, a merger
of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company with and
into the Association, which would have the effect provided in the
plan of reorganization and the law of the jurisdiction in which such
subsidiary is incorporated. As part of the restructuring, the Board
of Directors may cause—

on the reorganization effective date, to common shares of the
Holding Company on a one for one basis, consistent with appli-
cable State or District of Columbia law; and
(2) Holding Company common shares to be registered with

(b) SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.—The plan of reorganization
adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to subsection (a) shall
be submitted to common shareholders of the Association for their
approval. The reorganization shall occur on the reorganization ef-
fective date, provided that the plan of reorganization has been ap-
proved by the affirmative votes, cast in person or by proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Association common stock.
(c) TRANSITION.—In the event the shareholders of the Associa-
tion approve the plan of reorganization under subsection (b), the
following provisions shall apply beginning on the reorganization ef-
fective date:

section, until the dissolution date the Association shall con-
tinue to have all of the rights, privileges and obligations set
forth in, and shall be subject to all of the limitations and re-
strictions of, section 439, and the Association shall continue to
carry out the purposes of such section. The Holding Company
and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the
Association) shall not be entitled to any of the rights, privi-
leges, and obligations, and shall not be subject to the limita-
tions and restrictions, applicable to the Association under sec-
tion 439, except as specifically provided in this section. The
Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company
(other than the Association or a subsidiary of the Association)

other than the remaining property. Subject to the pre-
ceding sentence, such transferred property shall include all

ence on the date of enactment of this section and any

tive date, employees of the Association shall become employees
of the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding

ciation, however, may obtain such management and oper-
ational support from persons or entities not associated with the

ment of such dividends as of the date of such declaration by

ital would be in compliance with the capital standards and re-
quirements set forth in section 439(r). If, at any time after the

with such capital standards, the Holding Company shall trans-
fer with due diligence to the Association additional capital in
such amounts as are necessary to ensure that the Association
again complies with the capital standards.

ment of any dividend under paragraph (4), the Association
shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that the payment
of the dividend will be made in compliance with paragraph (4)

uate and professional students;

tions of the repayment plans available under paragraph (1) are
not adequate to accommodate the borrower’s exceptional cir-
cumstances. In designing such alternative repayment plans,

cost to the Federal Government, as determined on the basis of
the present value of future payments by such borrowers, of
loans made using the plans available under paragraph (1).

quire any borrower who has defaulted on a loan made under

priate repayment schedule.

schedules shall be established by regulations promulgated by

to the appropriate portion of the annual income of the borrower
(and the borrower’s spouse, if applicable) as determined by the

(i) $5,000;
(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount re-
ceived and used under this part in the second preceding fiscal
year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of
instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at
such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by
(III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institu-
tion in such fiscal year; or
(iii) 90 percent of the institution’s allocation under this
part for the preceding fiscal year.
(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this para-

which—
(i) was a first-time participant in the program in fiscal
year 2000 or any subsequent fiscal year, and

subsection in its second year of participation.
(D) For any fiscal year after a fiscal year in which an institu-

cess eligible amount bears to the sum of the excess eligible
amounts of all such eligible institutions (having such excess eligible
amounts).
(2) For any eligible institution, the excess eligible amount is
the amount, if any, by which—
(A)(i) that institution’s eligible amount (as determined
under paragraph (3)), divided by (ii) the sum of the eligible
amounts of all institutions (as so determined), multiplied by
(iii) the amount appropriated pursuant to section 461(b) for the

under subsection (a),
except that an eligible institution which has a cohort default rate
in excess of the applicable maximum cohort default rate under sub-
section (f) may not receive an allocation under this paragraph.

mined under subsection (c); minus
(B) the institution’s anticipated collections; multiplied by
(C) the institution’s default penalty, as determined under
subsection (e);
except that, if the institution has a cohort default rate in excess of
the applicable maximum cohort default rate under subsection (f),
the eligible amount of that institution is zero.
(c) DETERMINATION OF INSTITUTION’S SELF-HELP NEED.—(1)
The amount of an institution’s self-help need is equal to the sum
of the self-help need of the institution’s eligible undergraduate stu-
dents and the self-help need of the institution’s eligible graduate
and professional students.

undergraduate students, the Secretary shall—
(A) establish various income categories for dependent and
independent undergraduate students;

of graduate and professional students, determined on the basis
of the average student aid index (computed in accordance with
part F of this title) of a representative sample within each in-
come category for the second preceding fiscal year;
(C) determine the average cost of attendance for all grad-
uate and professional students;

determination is made and the 2 succeeding fiscal years,
unless, within 30 days of receiving notification from the
Secretary of the loss of eligibility under this paragraph,
the institution appeals the loss of eligibility to the Sec-
retary. The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such
appeal within 45 days after the submission of the appeal.
Such decision may permit the institution to continue to
participate in a program under this part if—
(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Secretary that the calculation of the institu-
tion’s cohort default rate is not accurate, and that re-
calculation would reduce the institution’s cohort de-
fault rate for any of the 3 fiscal years below 50 per-
cent; or
(ii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary,
such a small number of borrowers entering repayment
that the application of this subparagraph would be in-
equitable.

stitution to continue to participate in a program under this
part.
(C) RETURN OF FUNDS.—Within 90 days after the date

tablished under this part by the institution that is the sub-
ject of the termination shall be distributed as follows:
(i) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount
which bears the same ratio to such balance (as of the
date of such distribution) as the total amount of Fed-
eral capital contributions to such fund by the Sec-
retary under this part bears to the sum of such Fed-
eral capital contributions and the capital contributions
to such fund made by the institution.
(ii) The remainder of such student loan fund shall
be paid to the institution.
(D) U SE OF RETURNED FUNDS.—Any funds returned to
the Secretary under this paragraph shall be reallocated to
institutions of higher education pursuant to subsection (i).

(1)(A) The term ‘‘cohort default rate’’ means, for any award
year in which 30 or more current and former students at the
institution enter repayment on loans under this part (received
for attendance at the institution), the percentage of those cur-
rent and former students who enter repayment on such loans
(received for attendance at that institution) in that award year
who default before the end of the following award year.
(B) For any award year in which less than 30 of the insti-
tution’s current and former students enter repayment, the
term ‘‘cohort default rate’’ means the percentage of such cur-
rent and former students who entered repayment on such
loans in any of the three most recent award years and who de-
fault before the end of the award year immediately following
the year in which they entered repayment.
(C) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution
of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, employee, or
any other entity or individual affiliated with such institution,
in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in
default for the purposes of this subsection.
(D) In the case of a student who has attended and bor-
rowed at more than one school, the student (and his or her
subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to the school for
attendance at which the student received the loan that entered
repayment in the award year.
(E) In determining the number of students who default be-
fore the end of such award year, the institution, in calculating
the cohort default rate, shall exclude—
(i) any loan on which the borrower has, after the time
periods specified in paragraph (2)—
(I) voluntarily made 6 consecutive payments;
(II) voluntarily made all payments currently due;
(III) repaid in full the amount due on the
loan; or
(IV) received a deferment or forbearance, based on
a condition that began prior to such time periods;
(ii) any loan which has, after the time periods speci-
fied in paragraph (2), been rehabilitated or canceled; and
(iii) any other loan that the Secretary determines
should be excluded from such determination.
(F) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to
prevent an institution from evading the application to that in-
stitution of a cohort default rate determination under this sub-
section through the use of such measures as branching, con-
solidation, change of ownership or control or other means as
determined by the Secretary.
(2) For purposes of calculating the cohort default rate
under this subsection, a loan shall be considered to be in de-
fault— (A) 240 days (in the case of a loan repayable monthly),
or (B) 270 days (in the case of a loan repayable quar-
terly),
after the borrower fails to make an installment payment when
due or to comply with other terms of the promissory note.

(1) IN GENERAL.—(A) If an institution of higher education
returns to the Secretary any portion of the sums allocated to
such institution under this section for any fiscal year, the Sec-
retary shall reallocate 80 percent of such returned portions to
participating institutions in an amount not to exceed such par-
ticipating institution’s excess eligible amounts as determined
under paragraph (2).
(B) For the purpose of this subsection, the term ‘‘partici-
pating institution’’ means an institution of higher education
that—
(i) was a participant in the program assisted under
this part in fiscal year 1999; and
(ii) did not receive an allocation under subsection (a)
in the fiscal year for which the reallocation determination
is made.
(2) EXCESS ELIGIBLE AMOUNT.—For any participating insti-
tution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by
which—
(A)(i) that institution’s eligible amount (as determined
under subsection (b)(3)), divided by (ii) the sum of the eli-
gible amounts of all participating institutions (as deter-
mined under paragraph (3)), multiplied by (iii) the amount
of funds available for reallocation under this subsection;
exceeds
(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institu-
tion under subsection (b).
(3) REMAINDER.—The Secretary shall reallocate the re-
mainder of such returned portions in accordance with regula-
tions of the Secretary.
(4) ALLOCATION REDUCTIONS.—If under paragraph (1) of
this subsection an institution returns more than 10 percent of
its allocation, the institution’s allocation for the next fiscal year
shall be reduced by the amount returned. The Secretary may
waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary
finds that enforcing it is contrary to the interest of the pro-
gram.

cerning student borrowers concerning whom the Secretary has re-
ceived a referral pursuant to section 467 and regarding loans held
by the Secretary or an institution.
(2) Each cooperative agreement made pursuant to paragraph
(1) shall be made in accordance with the requirements of section

by the Secretary or an institution, as the case may be, to such con-
sumer reporting agencies, with respect to any loan held by the Sec-
retary or the institution, respectively, of—
(A) the date of disbursement and the amount of such loans

est or principal only, renewable at 12-month intervals for a period
not to exceed 3 years, on such terms as are otherwise consistent

writing by the parties to the loan, if—

cent of such borrower’s gross income;

qualify for forbearance for other reasons; or
(C) the borrower is eligible for interest payments to be

eligibility, the interest on such loan is being paid under sub-
section (j), except that the form of a forbearance under this

(f) SPECIAL REPAYMENT RULE AUTHORITY.—(1) Subject to such
restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe to protect the interest
of the United States, in order to encourage repayment of loans
made under this part which are in default, the Secretary may, in
the agreement entered into under this part, authorize an institu-
tion of higher education to compromise on the repayment of such
defaulted loans in accordance with paragraph (2). The Federal
share of the compromise repayment shall bear the same relation to
the institution’s share of such compromise repayment as the Fed-
eral capital contribution to the institution’s loan fund under this
part bears to the institution’s capital contribution to such fund.
(2) No compromise repayment of a defaulted loan as authorized
by paragraph (1) may be made unless the student borrower pays—
(A) 90 percent of the loan under this part;
(B) the interest due on such loan; and
(C) any collection fees due on such loan;
in a lump sum payment.

discharge the borrower’s liability on the loan (including the in-
terest and collection fees) and shall subsequently pursue any
claim available to such borrower against the institution and
the institution’s affiliates and principals, or settle the loan obli-
gation pursuant to the financial responsibility standards de-
scribed in section 498(c).

charged pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to have

amount that does not exceed the amount discharged against
the institution and the institution’s affiliates and principals.
(3) ELIGIBILITY FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE.—The period
during which a student was unable to complete a course of
study due to the closing of the institution shall not be consid-
ered for purposes of calculating the student’s period of eligi-
bility for additional assistance under this title.
(4) SPECIAL RULE.—A borrower whose loan has been dis-
charged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded, be-
cause of that discharge, from receiving additional grant, loan,
or work assistance under this title for which the borrower
would be otherwise eligible (but for the default on the dis-
charged loan). The amount discharged under this subsection
shall be treated as an amount canceled under section 465(a).
(5) REPORTING.—The Secretary or institution, as the case
may be, shall report to consumer reporting agencies with re-
spect to loans that have been discharged pursuant to this sub-
section.
(h) REHABILITATION OF LOANS.—
(1) REHABILITATION.—
(A) I N GENERAL.—If the borrower of a loan made
under this part who has defaulted on the loan makes 9 on-
time, consecutive, monthly payments of amounts owed on
the loan, as determined by the institution, or by the Sec-
retary in the case of a loan held by the Secretary, the loan
shall be considered rehabilitated, and the institution that
made that loan (or the Secretary, in the case of a loan held
by the Secretary) shall request that any consumer report-
ing agency to which the default was reported remove the
default from the borrower’s credit history.
(B) COMPARABLE CONDITIONS.—As long as the bor-
rower continues to make scheduled repayments on a loan
rehabilitated under this paragraph, the rehabilitated loan
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, and
qualify for the same benefits and privileges, as other loans
made under this part.
(C) ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE.—The borrower of a reha-
bilitated loan shall not be precluded by section 484 from
receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under
this title (for which the borrower is otherwise eligible) on
the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such rehabilita-
tion.(D) LIMITATIONS.—A borrower only once may obtain
the benefit of this paragraph with respect to rehabilitating
a loan under this part.
(2) RESTORATION OF ELIGIBILITY.—If the borrower of a loan
made under this part who has defaulted on that loan makes
6 ontime, consecutive, monthly payments of amounts owed on
such loan, the borrower’s eligibility for grant, loan, or work as-
sistance under this title shall be restored to the extent that the
borrower is otherwise eligible. A borrower only once may ob-
tain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to restored eligi-
bility.

centive repayment program may—

award year 2023–2024 and each subsequent award year, the Sec-
retary shall publish in the Federal Register revised income protec-
tion allowances for the purposes of subsections (c)(3) and (g)(2)(C)
of section 475, subclauses (I) and (II) of section 476(b)(1)(A)(iii), and

(2) REVISED TABLES.—For award year 2023–2024 and each
subsequent award year, the Secretary shall publish in the Fed-
eral Register a revised table of the adjusted net worth of a
farm or business for purposes of section 480(f). Such revised
table shall be developed—
(A) by increasing each dollar amount that refers to net
worth of a farm or business by a percentage equal to the
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index between

of such award year, and rounding the result to the nearest
$5,000; and
(B) by adjusting the dollar amounts in the column re-
ferring to the adjusted net worth to reflect the changes
made pursuant to subparagraph (A).
(d) ASSET PROTECTION ALLOWANCE.—For award year 2023–
2024 and each subsequent award year, the Secretary shall publish
in the Federal Register a revised table of allowances for the pur-
pose of sections 475(d)(2), 476(c)(2), and 477(c)(2). Such revised
table shall be developed by determining the present value cost,
rounded to the nearest $100, of an annuity that would provide, for
each age cohort of 40 and above, a supplemental income at age 65
(adjusted for inflation) equal to the difference between the mod-
erate family income (as most recently determined by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics), and the current average social security retire-
ment benefits. For each age cohort below 40, the allowance shall
be computed by decreasing the allowance for age 40, as updated,
by one-fifteenth for each year of age below age 40 and rounding the
result to the nearest $100. In making such determinations—
(1) the tables of allowances specified in sections 475(d)(2),
476(c)(2), and 477(c)(2) shall be considered to be for award year
2021–2022 for the purposes of calculating inflation;
(2) inflation shall be presumed to be 6 percent per year;

2023–2024 and each subsequent award year, the Secretary shall
publish in the Federal Register a revised table of assessments from
adjusted available income for the purpose of sections 475(e) and
477(d). Such revised table shall be developed—
(1) by increasing each dollar amount that refers to ad-
justed available income by a percentage equal to the percent-
age increase in the Consumer Price Index between April 2020
and the April in the year prior to the beginning of such aca-
demic year, rounded to the nearest $100; and

changes made pursuant to paragraph (1).

‘‘Consumer Price Index’’ means the Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor. Each an-
nual update of tables to reflect changes in the Consumer Price
Index shall be corrected for misestimation of actual changes in
such Index in previous years.
(g) E MPLOYMENT EXPENSE ALLOWANCE.—For award year 2023–
2024 and each succeeding award year, the Secretary shall publish
in the Federal Register a revised table of employment expense al-
lowances for the purpose of sections 475(c)(4), 476(b)(3), and
477(b)(4). Such revised table shall be developed by increasing the
dollar amount specified in sections 475(c)(4), 476(b)(3), and
477(b)(4) by a percentage equal to the percentage increase in the
Consumer Price Index, as defined in subsection (f), between April
2020 and the April in the year prior to the beginning of the award
year and rounding the result to the nearest $10.
(h) CLARIFICATION FOR AWARD YEAR 2023–2024.—For award
year 2023–2024, the Secretary shall determine adjusted amounts
and prescribe revised tables with respect to the income protection,
employment expense, and asset protection allowances and the as-
sessment schedules under sections 475, 476, and 477, pursuant to
this section. The amounts and tables specified in sections 475, 476,
and 477 with respect to such allowances and schedules shall only
be used by the Secretary as a baseline for adjustments and table
revisions prescribed in accordance with this section.

poses of subsection (b), the amount of grant and loan as-

half, for the payment period or period of enrollment,

tion if, within 150 percent of the normal time for completion of or
graduation from the program, the student has completed or grad-
uated from the program, or enrolled in any program of an eligible
institution for which the prior program provides substantial prepa-
ration. The information required to be disclosed under such sub-

ents of a loan made under part B or D (other than a loan made
under section 428H or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford
Loan) who did not receive a Federal Pell Grant, and by recipi-
ents of neither a Federal Pell Grant nor a loan made under
part B or D (other than a loan made under section 428H or a
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan), if the number of
students in such subgroup or with such status is sufficient to
yield statistically reliable information and reporting will not
reveal personally identifiable information about an individual
student. If such number is not sufficient for such purposes,
then the institution shall note that the institution enrolled too
few of such students to so disclose or report with confidence
and confidentiality.

counseling to borrowers of loans that are made, insured, or guaran-
teed under part B (other than loans made pursuant to section 428C
or loans under section 428B made on behalf of a student) or made
under part D (other than Federal Direct Consolidation Loans or
Federal Direct PLUS Loans made on behalf of a student) or made
under part E of this title prior to the completion of the course of
study for which the borrower enrolled at the institution or at the
time of departure from such institution. The counseling required by

53 Section 3(1) of Public Law 116-251 amends section 485(b)(viii) by striking ‘‘and’’ after the
semicolon. According to section 6 of such law, this amendment will take effect on June 20, 2021.
Such amendment probably should have included a reference to paragraph (1)(A) of section
485(b); however, such amendment was carried out to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
54 Section 3(2) of Public Law 116–251 provides for an amendment to section 485(b) of this Act
by adding at the end a new clause (x). Section 6 of such Public Law provides: ‘‘This Act, and
the amendments made by this Act, shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the date
of enactment of this Act’’ [effective date is June 20, 2021].
The placement of this new clause at the end of paragraph (1)(A) reflects the probable intent
of Congress. Also, the margin for such clause (x) (as added) does not conform with existing mar-
gins.
(vi) the consequences of defaulting on a loan, including ad-

Loan to discharge the borrower’s loans under parts B, D, and
E, including at a minimum—

paid, fees to be paid, and length of repayment;
(II) the effects of consolidation on a borrower’s under-
lying loan benefits, including grace periods, loan forgive-
ness, cancellation, and deferment opportunities;
(III) the option of the borrower to prepay the loan or
to change repayment plans; and
(IV) that borrower benefit programs may vary among
different lenders;
(viii) a general description of the types of tax benefits that
may be available to borrowers; 53
(ix) a notice to borrowers about the availability of the Na-
tional Student Loan Data System and how the system can be
used by a borrower to obtain information on the status of the
borrower’s loans; and
(x) 54 an explanation that—
(I) the borrower may be contacted during the
repayment period by third-party student debt re-
lief companies;
(II) the borrower should use caution when
dealing with those companies; and
(III) the services that those companies typi-
cally provide are already offered to borrowers free
of charge through the Department or the bor-
rower’s servicer; and
(B) In the case of borrower who leaves an institution without
the prior knowledge of the institution, the institution shall attempt
to provide the information described in subparagraph (A) to the
student in writing.
(2)(A) Each eligible institution shall require that the borrower
of a loan made under part B, D, or E submit to the institution, dur-
ing the exit interview required by this subsection—
(i) the borrower’s expected permanent address after leav-
ing the institution (regardless of the reason for leaving);
(ii) the name and address of the borrower’s expected em-

or potential students in obtaining information as specified in sub-
section (a). The Secretary may, by regulation, waive the require-
ment that an employee or employees be available on a full-time
basis for carrying out responsibilities required under this section
whenever an institution in which the total enrollment, or the por-
tion of the enrollment participating in programs under this title at

of this section, so that individual and institutional participants will
be fully aware of their rights and responsibilities under such pro-
grams. In particular, such information shall include information to
enable students and prospective students to assess the debt burden
and monthly and total repayment obligations that will be incurred
as a result of receiving loans of varying amounts under this title.
Such information shall also include information on the various pay-
ment options available for student loans, including income-sen-
sitive and income-based repayment plans for loans made, insured,

assess the practical consequences of loan consolidation, including
differences in deferment eligibility, interest rates, monthly pay-
ments, and finance charges, and samples of loan consolidation pro-
files to illustrate such consequences. The Secretary shall provide

which students may obtain partial or total cancellation or defer re-
payment of loans for service, shall indicate (in terms of the Federal
minimum wage) the maximum level of compensation and allow-
ances that a student borrower may receive from a tax-exempt orga-

Department’s Internet site to include direct links to databases that
contain information on public and private financial assistance pro-
grams. The Secretary shall only provide direct links to databases
that can be accessed without charge and shall make reasonable ef-
forts to verify that the databases included in a direct link are not
providing fraudulent information. The Secretary shall prominently
display adjacent to any such direct link a disclaimer indicating that
a direct link to a database does not constitute an endorsement or
recommendation of the database, the provider of the database, or
any services or products of such provider. The Secretary shall pro-
vide additional direct links to information resources from which
students may obtain information about fraudulent and deceptive
practices in the provision of services related to student financial

paragraph (1). If the institution is a member of a national colle-
giate athletic association that compiles graduation rate data on be-
half of the association’s member institutions that the Secretary de-
termines is substantially comparable to the information described
in paragraph (1), the distribution of the compilation of such data

a recognized foreign aid service of the Federal Govern-
ment; or
(B) in cases where the students described in subpara-
graph (A) represent 20 percent or more of the certificate-
or degree-seeking, full-time, undergraduate students at the
institution, calculate the completion or graduation rates of
such students by excluding from the calculations described
in paragraph (1) the time period during which such stu-
dents were not enrolled due to their service in the Armed
Forces, on official church missions, or with a recognized
foreign aid service of the Federal Government.
(4) Each institution of higher education described in paragraph
(1) may provide supplemental information to students and the Sec-
retary showing the completion or graduation rate when such com-
pletion or graduation rate includes students transferring into and
out of such institution.
(5) The Secretary, using the reports submitted under this sub-
section, shall compile and publish a report containing the informa-
tion required under paragraph (1) broken down by—

giate Athletic Association and the National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics.

lish data that, in the opinion of the Secretary, is substantially com-
parable to the information required under this subsection.

ticipate in a program of intercollegiate athletics at an institution
of higher education in order to be eligible to receive such assist-
ance.

(and section 439(o) of this Act as in effect prior to the enactment
of section 428C) and loans guaranteed under under part A of title
VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292 et seq.), offer

bill to the borrower for the repayment of all such loans for the
monthly or other similar period of repayment.
(b) APPLICABILITY OF OTHER REQUIREMENTS.—A lender offering
a combined payment plan shall comply with all provisions of sec-
tion 428C applicable to loans consolidated or to be consolidated and
shall comply with all provisions of part A of title VII of the Public
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292 et seq.) applicable to loans under
that subpart which are made part of the combined payment plan,
except that a lender offering a combined payment plan under this
section may offer consolidation loans pursuant to section
428C(b)(1)(A) if such lender holds any outstanding loan of a bor-
rower which is selected for inclusion in a combined payment plan.
(c) LENDER ELIGIBILITY.—Such lender may offer a combined
payment plan only if—
(1) the lender holds an outstanding loan of that borrower
which is selected by the borrower for incorporation into a com-
bined payment plan pursuant to this section (including loans
which are selected by the borrower for consolidation under this
section); or
(2) the borrower certifies that the borrower has sought and
has been unable to obtain a combined payment plan from the
holders of the outstanding loans of that borrower.
(d) BORROWER SELECTION OF COMPETING OFFERS.—In the case
of multiple offers by lenders to administer a combined payment
plan for a borrower, the borrower shall select from among them the
lender to administer the combined payment plan including its loan
consolidation component.
(e) EFFECT OF PLAN.—Upon selection of a lender to administer
the combined payment plan, the lender may reissue any loan under
part A of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292
et seq.) selected by the borrower for incorporation in the combined
payment plan which is not held by such lender and the proceeds
of such reissued loan shall be paid by the lender to the holder or
holders of the loans so selected to discharge the liability on such
loans, if—

by the borrower. The Secretary of Health and Human Services
shall insure such loan under a certificate of comprehensive insur-
ance with no insurance limit, but any such certificate shall only be
issued to an authorized holder of loans insured under part A of
title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292 et seq.)
(including the Student Loan Marketing Association). Such certifi-
cates shall provide that all loans reissued under this section shall
be fully insured against loss of principal and interest. Any insur-
ance issued with respect to loans reissued under this section shall
be excluded from the limitation on maximum insurance authority
set forth in section 710 of the Public Health Service Act. Notwith-
standing the provisions of section 729(a) of the Public Health Serv-
ice Act, the reissued loan shall be made in an amount, including
outstanding principal, capitalized interest, accrued unpaid interest
not yet capitalized, and authorized late charges. The proceeds of
each such loan will be paid by the lender to the holder of the origi-
nal loan being reissued and the borrower’s obligation to that holder
on that loan shall be discharged.
(2) Except as otherwise specifically provided for under the pro-
visions of this section, the terms of any reissued loan shall be the
same as the terms of the original loan. The maximum repayment
period for a loan reissued under this section shall not exceed the
remainder of the period which would have been permitted on the
original loan. If the lender holds more than one loan insured under
part A of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292
et seq.), the maximum repayment period for all such loans may ex-
tend to the latest date permitted for any individual loan. Any re-
issued loan may be consolidated with any other Health Education
Assistance Loan as provided in the Public Health Service Act, and,
with the concurrence of the borrower, repayment of any such loans
during any period may be made in amounts that are less than the
interest that accrues on such loans during that period.
(g) TERMINATION OF BORROWER ELIGIBILITY.—The status of an
individual as an eligible combined payment plan borrower termi-
nates upon receipt of a combined payment plan.
(h) FEES AND PREMIUMS.—No origination fee or insurance pre-
mium shall be charged to the borrower on any combined payment
plan, and no origination fee or insurance premium shall be payable
by the lender to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
(i) COMMENCEMENT OF REPAYMENT.—Repayment of a combined
payment plan shall commence within 60 days after the later of the

cluding distance education or correspondence courses or pro-
grams, are of sufficient quality to achieve, for the duration of
the accreditation period, the stated objective for which the
courses or the programs are offered; and
(B) if such agency or association has or seeks to include
within its scope of recognition the evaluation of the quality of
institutions or programs offering distance education or cor-
respondence education, such agency or association shall, in ad-
dition to meeting the other requirements of this subpart, dem-
onstrate to the Secretary that—
(i) the agency or association’s standards effectively ad-
dress the quality of an institution’s distance education or
correspondence education in the areas identified in para-

nize the accreditation of any institution of higher education unless
the institution of higher education agrees to submit any dispute in-
volving the final denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation
to initial arbitration prior to any other legal action.
(f) JURISDICTION.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
any civil action brought by an institution of higher education seek-
ing accreditation from, or accredited by, an accrediting agency or

and involving the denial, withdrawal, or termination of accredita-
tion of the institution of higher education, shall be brought in the
appropriate United States district court.
(g) LIMITATION ON SCOPE OF CRITERIA.—Nothing in this Act

such agency or association and demonstrates to the Secretary rea-
sonable cause for its accreditation by more than one agency or as-
sociation. If the institution is accredited, as an institution, by more
than one accrediting agency or association, the institution shall
designate which agency’s accreditation shall be utilized in deter-
mining the institution’s eligibility for programs under this Act.
(j) IMPACT OF LOSS OF ACCREDITATION.—An institution may
not be certified or recertified as an institution of higher education

of the other programs authorized by this Act if such institution—
(1) is not currently accredited by any agency or association
recognized by the Secretary;
(2) has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or other-
wise terminated for cause during the preceding 24 months, un-
less such withdrawal, revocation, or termination has been re-
scinded by the same accrediting agency; or

show cause or suspension order during the preceding 24
months, unless such order has been rescinded by the same ac-
crediting agency.
(k) R ELIGIOUS INSTITUTION RULE.—Notwithstanding subsection
(j), the Secretary shall allow an institution that has had its accredi-
tation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated, or has volun-
tarily withdrawn from an accreditation agency, to remain certified
as an institution of higher education under section 102 and subpart
3 of this part for a period sufficient to allow such institution to ob-
tain alternative accreditation, if the Secretary determines that the
reason for the withdrawal, revocation, or termination—
(1) is related to the religious mission or affiliation of the
institution; and
(2) is not related to the accreditation criteria provided for
in this section.
(l) L IMITATION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION OF RECOGNI-
TION.—(1) If the Secretary determines that an accrediting agency
or association has failed to apply effectively the criteria in this sec-
tion, or is otherwise not in compliance with the requirements of
this section, the Secretary shall—

accreditation from the accrediting agency or association during any
period in which the institution is the subject of any interim action
by another accrediting agency or association, described in para-
graph (2)(A)(i), (2)(B), or (2)(C) of subsection (a) of this section,
leading to the suspension, revocation, or termination of accredita-
tion or the institution has been notified of the threatened loss of
accreditation, and the due process procedures required by such sus-
pension, revocation, termination, or threatened loss have not been
completed.
(m) LIMITATION ON THE SECRETARY’S AUTHORITY.—The Sec-
retary may only recognize accrediting agencies or associations
which accredit institutions of higher education for the purpose of
enabling such institutions to establish eligibility to participate in
the programs under this Act or which accredit institutions of high-
er education or higher education programs for the purpose of ena-
bling them to establish eligibility to participate in other programs
administered by the Department of Education or other Federal
agencies.
(n) INDEPENDENT EVALUATION.—(1) The Secretary shall con-
duct a comprehensive review and evaluation of the performance of
all accrediting agencies or associations which seek recognition by
the Secretary in order to determine whether such accrediting agen-
cies or associations meet the criteria established by this section.
The Secretary shall conduct an independent evaluation of the infor-
mation provided by such agency or association. Such evaluation
shall include—
(A) the solicitation of third-party information concerning
the performance of the accrediting agency or association; and
(B) site visits, including unannounced site visits as appro-
priate, at accrediting agencies and associations, and, at the
Secretary’s discretion, at representative member institutions.
(2) The Secretary shall place a priority for review of accrediting
agencies or associations on those agencies or associations that ac-
credit institutions of higher education that participate most exten-
sively in the programs authorized by this title and on those agen-
cies or associations which have been the subject of the most com-
plaints or legal actions.
(3) The Secretary shall consider all available relevant informa-
tion concerning the compliance of the accrediting agency or associa-
tion with the criteria provided for in this section, including any
complaints or legal actions against such agency or association. In
cases where deficiencies in the performance of an accreditation
agency or association with respect to the requirements of this sec-
tion are noted, the Secretary shall take these deficiencies into ac-
count in the recognition process. The Secretary shall not, under
any circumstances, base decisions on the recognition or denial of
recognition of accreditation agencies or associations on criteria
other than those contained in this section. When the Secretary de-
cides to recognize an accrediting agency or association, the Sec-
retary shall determine the agency or association’s scope of recogni-
tion. If the agency or association reviews institutions offering dis-
tance education courses or programs and the Secretary determines
that the agency or association meets the requirements of this sec-
tion, then the agency shall be recognized and the scope of recogni-

tion shall include accreditation of institutions offering distance edu-
cation courses or programs.
(4) The Secretary shall maintain sufficient documentation to
support the conclusions reached in the recognition process, and, if
the Secretary does not recognize any accreditation agency or asso-
ciation, shall make publicly available the reason for denying rec-
ognition, including reference to the specific criteria under this sec-
tion which have not been fulfilled.
(o) REGULATIONS.—The Secretary shall by regulation provide
procedures for the recognition of accrediting agencies or associa-
tions and for the appeal of the Secretary’s decisions. Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, the Secretary shall not pro-
mulgate any regulation with respect to the standards of an accredi-
tation agency or association described in subsection (a)(5).
(p) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in subsection (a)(5) shall
be construed to restrict the ability of—
(1) an accrediting agency or association to set, with the in-
volvement of its members, and to apply, accreditation stand-
ards for or to institutions or programs that seek review by the
agency or association; or
(2) an institution to develop and use institutional stand-
ards to show its success with respect to student achievement,
which achievement may be considered as part of any accredita-
tion review.
(q) REVIEW OF SCOPE CHANGES.—The Secretary shall require a
review, at the next available meeting of the National Advisory
Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, of any change in
scope undertaken by an agency or association under subsection
(a)(4)(B)(i)(II) if the enrollment of an institution that offers distance
education or correspondence education that is accredited by such
agency or association increases by 50 percent or more within any
one institutional fiscal year.

which is performed at its branches;
(3) requires—
(A) a description of the third party servicers of an in-
stitution of higher education; and

mines will ensure compliance with the requirements of this
title with respect to eligibility, accreditation, administrative ca-
pability and financial responsibility; and

tion in one or more of the programs under part B or D.
(c) FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STANDARDS.—(1) The Secretary

tions and statements;

comply with the requirements of this title; and
(C) to meet all of its financial obligations, including (but
not limited to) refunds of institutional charges and repayments
to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs
administered by the Secretary.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if an institution fails to
meet criteria prescribed by the Secretary regarding ratios that
demonstrate financial responsibility, then the institution shall pro-
vide the Secretary with satisfactory evidence of its financial respon-
sibility in accordance with paragraph (3). Such criteria shall take
into account any differences in generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples, and the financial statements required thereunder, that are
applicable to for-profit, public, and nonprofit institutions. The Sec-
retary shall take into account an institution’s total financial cir-
cumstances in making a determination of its ability to meet the
standards herein required.
(3) The Secretary shall determine an institution to be finan-
cially responsible, notwithstanding the institution’s failure to meet
the criteria under paragraphs (1) and (2), if—
(A) such institution submits to the Secretary third-party fi-
nancial guarantees that the Secretary determines are reason-
able, such as performance bonds or letters of credit payable to
the Secretary, which third-party financial guarantees shall
equal not less than one-half of the annual potential liabilities
of such institution to the Secretary for funds under this title,

generally accepted auditing standards, that the institution has
sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of
the institution, including the ability to meet all of its financial
obligations (including refunds of institutional charges and re-
payments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in
programs administered by the Secretary); or
(D) such institution has met standards of financial respon-
sibility, prescribed by the Secretary by regulation, that indicate
a level of financial strength not less than those required in
paragraph (2).
(4) If an institution of higher education that provides a 2-year
or 4-year program of instruction for which the institution awards
an associate or baccalaureate degree fails to meet the criteria im-
posed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2), the Secretary
shall waive that particular requirement for that institution if the
institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—
(A) there is no reasonable doubt as to its continued sol-
vency and ability to deliver quality educational services;
(B) it is current in its payment of all current liabilities, in-
cluding student refunds, repayments to the Secretary, payroll,
and payment of trade creditors and withholding taxes; and
(C) it has substantial equity in school-occupied facilities,
the acquisition of which was the direct cause of its failure to
meet the criteria.
(5) The determination as to whether an institution has met the
standards of financial responsibility provided for in paragraphs (2)
and (3)(C) shall be based on an audited and certified financial
statement of the institution. Such audit shall be conducted by a
qualified independent organization or person in accordance with
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Such statement shall be submitted to the Secretary at
the time such institution is considered for certification or recertifi-
cation under this section. If the institution is permitted to be cer-
tified (provisionally or otherwise) and such audit does not establish
compliance with paragraph (2), the Secretary may require that ad-
ditional audits be submitted.
(6)(A) The Secretary shall establish requirements for the main-
tenance by an institution of higher education of sufficient cash re-
serves to ensure repayment of any required refunds.
(B) The Secretary shall provide for a process under which the
Secretary shall exempt an institution of higher education from the
requirements described in subparagraph (A) if the Secretary deter-
mines that the institution—

tution of higher education will comply with administrative ca-
pability required by this title.
(e) FINANCIAL GUARANTEES FROM OWNERS.—(1) Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, the Secretary may, to the ex-
tent necessary to protect the financial interest of the United States,

or seeking to participate, in a program under this title, or from
one or more individuals who the Secretary determines, in ac-
cordance with paragraph (2), exercise substantial control over
such institution, or both, in an amount determined by the Sec-
retary to be sufficient to satisfy the institution’s potential li-
ability to the Federal Government, student assistance recipi-
ents, and other program participants for funds under this title;
and (B) the assumption of personal liability, by one or more in-
dividuals who exercise substantial control over such institu-
tion, as determined by the Secretary in accordance with para-
graph (2), for financial losses to the Federal Government, stu-
dent assistance recipients, and other program participants for
funds under this title, and civil and criminal monetary pen-
alties authorized under this title.
(2)(A) The Secretary may determine that an individual exer-
cises substantial control over one or more institutions participating
in a program under this title if the Secretary determines that—
(i) the individual directly or indirectly controls a substan-
tial ownership interest in the institution;
(ii) the individual, either alone or together with other indi-
viduals, represents, under a voting trust, power of attorney,
proxy, or similar agreement, one or more persons who have, in-
dividually or in combination with the other persons rep-
resented or the individual representing them, a substantial
ownership interest in the institution; or

the chief executive officer, or other executive officer of the in-
stitution or of an entity that holds a substantial ownership in-
terest in the institution.
(B) The Secretary may determine that an entity exercises sub-
stantial control over one or more institutions participating in a pro-
gram under this title if the Secretary determines that the entity di-
rectly or indirectly holds a substantial ownership interest in the in-
stitution.

(C) willfully fails to pay such refund or willfully attempts
in any manner to evade payment of such refund,
shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to

nancial responsibility is being determined for the first
time;
(ii) there is a complete or partial change of ownership,

(iii) the Secretary determines that an institution that
seeks to renew its certification is, in the judgment of the
Secretary, in an administrative or financial condition that

sibilities under a program participation agreement.
(2) Whenever the Secretary withdraws the recognition of any
accrediting agency, an institution of higher education which meets
the requirements of accreditation, eligibility, and certification on
the day prior to such withdrawal, the Secretary may, notwith-
standing the withdrawal, continue the eligibility of the institution
of higher education to participate in the programs authorized by
this title for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the
withdrawal of recognition.
(3) If, prior to the end of a period of provisional certification

TITLE V—DEVELOPING INSTITUTIONS
PART A—HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTIONS
SEC. 501. ø20 U.S.C. 1101¿ FINDINGS; PURPOSE; AND PROGRAM AU-
THORITY.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Hispanic Americans are at high risk of not enrolling or
graduating from institutions of higher education.
(2) Disparities between the enrollment of non-Hispanic
white students and Hispanic students in postsecondary edu-
cation are increasing. Between 1973 and 1994, enrollment of
white secondary school graduates in 4-year institutions of high-
er education increased at a rate two times higher than that of
Hispanic secondary school graduates.
(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, Hispanic-
serving institutions provide a significant proportion of postsec-
ondary opportunities for Hispanic students.
(4) Relative to other institutions of higher education, His-
panic-serving institutions are underfunded. Such institutions
receive significantly less in State and local funding, per full-
time equivalent student, than other institutions of higher edu-
cation.
(5) Hispanic-serving institutions are succeeding in edu-
cating Hispanic students despite significant resource problems
that— (A) limit the ability of such institutions to expand and
improve the academic programs of such institutions; and
(B) could imperil the financial and administrative sta-
bility of such institutions.

(6) There is a national interest in remedying the dispari-
ties described in paragraphs (2) and (4) and ensuring that His-
panic students have an equal opportunity to pursue postsec-
ondary opportunities.
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this title is to—
(1) expand educational opportunities for, and improve the
academic attainment of, Hispanic students; and

quality, and institutional stability of colleges and universities
that are educating the majority of Hispanic college students
and helping large numbers of Hispanic students and other low-
income individuals complete postsecondary degrees.
(c) PROGRAM AUTHORITY.—The Secretary shall provide grants
and related assistance to Hispanic-serving institutions to enable
such institutions to improve and expand their capacity to serve
Hispanic students and other low-income individuals.

ductive relationship which benefits the Nation’s future eco-
nomic interests;
(3) few linkages presently exist between the manpower
and information needs of United States business and the inter-
national education, language training and research capacities
of institutions of higher education in the United States, and
public and private organizations; and
