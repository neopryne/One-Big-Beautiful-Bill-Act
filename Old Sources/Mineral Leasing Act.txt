deposits contiguous to these embraced in such lease, but in no event shall the total area
embraced in such modified lease exceed in the aggregate two thousand five hundred and
sixty acres.
Sec.4. That upon satisfactory showing by any lessee to the Secretary of the Interior that
all of the workable deposits of coal within a tract covered by his or its lease will be
exhausted, worked out, or removed within three years thereafter, the Secretary of the
Interior may, within his discretion, lease to such lessee an additional tract of land or coal
deposits, which, including the coal area remaining the existing lease shall not exceed two
thousand five hundred and sixty acres, through the same procedures and under the same
conditions as in case of an original lease.

single lease noncontiguous tracts which can be operated as a single mine or unit.
Sec.7. That of the privileges of mining or extracting the coal in the lands covered by
the lease the lessee shall pay to the United States such royalties as may be specified in the
lease, which shall be fixed in advance of offering the same, and which shall not be less
than 5 cents per ton of two thousand pounds, due and payable at the end of each third
month succeeding that of the extraction of the coal from the mine, and an annual rental,
payable at the date of such lease and annually thereafter, on the lands or coal deposits
covered by such lease, at such rate as may be fixed by the Secretary of the Interior prior
to offering the same, which shall not be less than 25 cents per acre for the first year
thereafter, no less than 50 cents per acre for the second, third, fourth, and fifth years,
respectively, and not less than $1 per acre for each and every year thereafter during the
continuance of the lease, except that such rental for any year shall be credited against the

condition of diligent development and continued operation shall be interrupted by strikes,
the elements, or casualties not attributable to the lessee, and upon the further condition
that at the end of each twenty-year period succeeding the date of the lease such
readjustment of terms and conditions may be made as the Secretary of the Interior may
determine, unless otherwise provided by law at the time of the expiration of such periods:

payments by the lessee of such bonus as may be accepted by the Secretary and of such
royalty as may be fixed in the lease which shall be not less than 12 ½ per centum in
amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease. When the lands to be
leased are not within any known geological structure of a producing oil or gas field, the
person first making applications for the lease who is qualified to hold a lease under this
Act shall be entitled to a lease of such lands without competitive bidding. Such lease
shall be conditioned upon the payment by the lessee of a royalty of 12 ½ per centum in

(c) tidelands or submerged lands) may be leased by the Secretary under the same
conditions as contained in the leasing provisions of the mineral leasing laws, subject to
the provision hereof. The provision of the Act of April 17, 1926 (44 Stat. 301), as
heretofore or hereafter amended, shall apply to deposits of sulfur covered by this Act

which has been transferred to the Department of the Interior by the Executive order for
Indian use, shall be deposited in a special fund in the Treasury until final disposition

one hundred and twenty acres in such State. The Secretary may, in his own discretion or
whenever sufficient public interest is manifested, reevaluate the lessee’s or permittee’s
need for all or any part of the land permit or permits covering all or any part of the
additional acreage, if he finds that such cancellation is in the public interest or that the
coal deposits in the additional acreage are no longer necessary for the lessee or permittee
to carry on business economically or if the lessee or permittee had divested himself of all
or any part of the original ten thousand two hundred and forty acres or no longer had
facilities which in the Secretary’s opinion enable him to exploit the deposits under lease
or permit. No assignment, transfer, or sale of any part of the additional acreage may be

“(c) If the lands to be leased are not within any known geological structure of a
producing oil or gas field, the person first making application for the lease who is
qualified to hold a lease under this Act shall be entitled to a lease of such lands without
competitive bidding. Such leases shall be conditioned upon the payment by the lessee of
a royalty of 12 ½ per centum in amount or value of the production removed or sold from
the lease.
“(d) All leases issued under this section shall be conditioned upon payment by the

prescribe, to approve operating, drilling, or development contracts made by one or more
lessees of oil or gas leases, with one or more person, association, or corporation
whenever, in his discretion, the conservation of natural products of the public
convenience or necessity may require it or the interest of the United States may be best
subserved thereby. All leases operated under such approved operation, frilling, or
development contracts, and interest, thereunder, shall be excepted in determining holding
or control under the provisions of this Act.

acreage in addition to that which is permissible under paragraph (1) of this subsection,
but the additional acreage shall not exceed five thousand one hundred and twenty acres,
in any one State. Each application shall be for forty acres or multiple thereof and shall
contain a statement that the granting of a lease or permit for the additional lands in
necessary to enable the applicant to carry on business economically and that it is believed
to be in the public interest. On the filing of such an application, the coal deposits in the
lands covered by it shall be temporarily set aside and withdrawn from all forms of
disposal under this Act. The Secretary shall, after posting notice of the pending
application in the local land office, conduct public hearing on it. After such hearing the
Secretary may, under such regulations as he may prescribe and to such extent as he finds
to be in the public interest and necessary to enable the applicant to carry on business
economically, permit the applicant to take and hold coal leases or permits for additional
acreage as hereinbefore provided. The Secretary may, in his own discretion or whenever
sufficient public interest is manifested, reevaluate the lessee’s or permittee’s need for all
or any part of the additional acreage and may cancel any lease or permit covering all or
any part of such acreage if he finds that cancellation in the public interest of that the coal
deposits in said acreage are not longer necessary for the lessee or permittee to carry on
business economically or that the lessee or permittee has divested himself of all or any
part of his first ten thousand two hundred and forty acres or no longer has facilities
which, in the Secretary’s opinion, enable him to exploit the deposits under lease or
permits. No assignment, transfer, or sale of any part of the additional acreage may be
made without the approval of the Secretary.

the economic mining of sodium compounds leasable under this Act, permit a person,
association, or corporation to take or hold sodium leases or permits on up to fifteen
thousand three hundred and sixty acres in any one State.

renewal is reserved by any party to the option) without the prior approval of the
Secretary. In any case in which an option to acquire the optionor’s entire interest in the
whole or a part of the acreage under a lease is entered into, the acreage to which the
option is applicable shall be charged both to the optionor and to the optionee, but the
charge to the optionor shall cease when the options is exercised. In any case in which an
option to acquire a part of the optionor’s interest in the whole or a part of the acreage
under a lease is entered into, the acreage to which the option is applicable shall be fully

associations or as a stockholder in other corporations holding, owning or controlling such
lease, options, or permits for any kind of minerals, exceeds in aggregate an amount
equivalent to the maximum number of acres of the respective kinds of mineral allowed to
any one lessee optionee, or permittee under this Act, except that no person shall be
charged with his pro rata share of any acreage holding of any association or corporation

“(2) No contract for development and operation of any lands leased under this act,
whether or not coupled with an interest in such lease, and no lease held, owned, or
controlled in common by two or more persons, associations, or corporations shall be

between or among the contracting parties or those who hold, own or control the lease in
common, but the proportionate interest of each part shall be charged against the total
acreage permitted to be held, owned or controlled by such party under this Act. The total
acreage so held, owned, or controlled in common by two or more parties shall not exceed,

means of stock or otherwise, in violation of any of the provisions of this Act, the lease
may be cancelled, or the interest so owned may be forfeited or the person so owning or
controlling the interest may be compelled to dispose of the interest, in any appropriate
proceeding instituted by Attorney General. Such a proceeding shall be instituted in the
United States district court for the district in which the leased property or some part
thereof is located or in which the defendant may be found.
“(2) The right to cancel or forfeit for violation of any of the provisions of this Act shall
not apply so as to affect adversely the title or interest of a bona fie purchaser of any lease,
interest in a lease, option to acquire a lease or an interest therein, or permit which lease,
interest, option or permit was acquired and is held by a qualified person, association, or
corporation in conformity with those provisions, even though the holding of a person,
association, or corporation from which the lease, interest, option, or permit was acquired,
or of his predecessor in title (including the original lessee of the United State) may have
been canceled for forfeited or may be or may have been subject to cancellation of
forfeiture for any such violation. If, in any such proceeding, an underlying lease, interest,
option, or permit is canceled or forfeited to the Government and there are valid interest
therein or valid options to acquire the lease or an interest therein which are not subject to
cancellation, forfeiture, or compulsory disposition the underlying lease, interest, option,
or permit shall be sold

general regulations subject to all outstanding valid interest therein and valid options
pertaining thereto. Likewise if, in any such proceeding, less than the whole interest in a
lease, interest, options, or permit is canceled or forfeited to the Government, the partial
interest so canceled of forfeited shall be sold by the Secretary to the highest responsible
qualified bidder by competitive bidding under general regulations. If competitive bidding
fails to produce a satisfactory offer the Secretary may, in either of these cases, shell the
interest in question by such other method as he deems appropriate on terms not less
favorable to the Government than those of the best competitive bid received.
“(3) The commencement and conclusion of every proceeding under this subsection
shall be promptly noted on the appropriate public records of the Bureau of Land
Management.

imitated prior to said date or thereafter, shall have the right to be dismissed promptly as
such a party upon showing that he holds and acquired as a bona fide purchaser the
interest involving him as such a party without violating any provision of this Act. No
hearing upon nay such showing shall be required unless the Secretary present pram facie
evidence indicating a possible violation of the Mineral Leasing Act on the part of the
alleged bona fide purchaser.
“(j) If during any such proceeding, a part thereto files with the Secretary a waiver of
his rights under his leases (including particularly, where applicable, rights to drill and to
assign) or if such rights suspended by the Secretary pending a decision in the
proceedings, whether initiated prior to enactment of this Act or thereafter, payment of
rentals and running of time against the term of the lease or leases involved shall be
suspended as of the first day of the month following the filing of the waiver or suspension
of the rights until the first day of the month following the final decision in the proceeding
of the revocation of the waiver or suspension.
“(k) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, if any lands or deposits subject to the
provision of this Act shall be subleased, trusted, possessed, or controlled by any device
permanently, temporarily, directly, indirectly, tacitly, or in any manner whatsoever, so
that they form a part of or are in any wise controlled by any combination in the form of

law under this section for failure to pay on or before the anniversary date the full amount
of rental due, but such rental was paid on or tendered within twenty days thereafter, and it
is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior that such failure was either
justifiable or not due to a lack of reasonable diligence on the part of the lessee, the
Secretary may reinstate the lease if —
“(1) a petition for reinstatement, together with the required rental, including back
rental accruing from the date of termination of the lease, is filed with the
Secretary; and
“(2) No valid lease has been issued affecting any of the lands covered by the
terminated lease prior to the filing of said petition. The Secretary shall not issue
any new lease affecting any of the lands covered by such terminated lease for a
reasonable period, as determined in accordance with regulations issued by him.
In any case where a reinstatement of a terminated lease is granted under this
subsection and the Secretary finds that the reinstatement of such lease will not
afford the lessee a reasonable opportunity to continue operations under the lease,
the Secretary may, at his discretion, extend the term of such lease for such period
as he deems reasonable: Provided, That (A) such extension shall not exceed a
period equivalent to the time beginning when the lessee knew or should have
known of the termination and ending on the date the Secretary grants such
petition; (B) such extension shall not exceed a period equal to the unexpired
portion of the lease or any extension thereof remaining at the date of
terminations; and (C) when the reinstatement occurs after the expiration of the
term or extension thereof the lease may be extended from the date the Secretary
grants the petition.”

GEOTHERMAL STEAM ACT OF 1970
December 24, 1970
To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to make disposition of geothermal steam and
associated geothermal resources, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled, That this Act may be cited as the “Geothermal Steam At
of 1970”.
Sec.2. As used in this Act, the term—
(a) “Secretary” means the Secretary of the Interior;
(b) “geothermal leases” means a lease issued under authority of this act;
(c) “geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources’ means (i) all
products of geothermal processes, embracing indigenous steam, hot water
and hot brines; (ii) steam and other gases, hot water and hot brines resulting
from water, gas, or other fluids artificially introduced into geothermal
formations; (iii) heat or other associated energy found in geothermal
formations; and (iv) any byproduct derived from them;
(d) “byproduct” means any mineral or minerals (exclusive of oil, hydrocarbon
gas, and helium) which are found in solution or in association with
geothermal steam and which have a valued of less than 75 per centum of the
value of the geothermal steam of are not, because of quantity, quality, or
technical difficulties in extraction and production, of sufficient value to
warrant extraction and production by themselves;
(e) “known geothermal resources area” means an area in which the geology,
nearby discoveries, competitive interest, or other indicia would, in the
opinion of the Secretary, engender a belief in men who are experienced in the
subject matter that the prospects for extraction of geothermal steam or
associated geothermal resources are good enough to warrant expenditures of
a money for that purpose.
Sec.3. Subject to the provisions of section 15 of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior
may issue leases for the development and utilization of the geothermal steam and
associated geothermal resources (1) in lands administered by him, including public,
withdrawn, and acquired lands, (2) in any national forest or other lands administered by
the Department of Agriculture through the Forest Service, including public, withdrawn,
and acquired lands, and (3) in lands which have been conveyed by the United States
subject to a reservation to the United States of the geothermal steam and associated
geothermal resources therein.
Sec.4. If lands to be leased under this Act are within any known geothermal resources
area, they shall be leased to the highest responsible qualified bidder by competitive
bidding under regulations formulated by the Secretary. If the lands to be leased are
within any known geothermal resources area, the qualified person first making
application for the lease shall be entitled to a lease of such lands without competitive
bidding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time

within one hundred and eighty days following the effective date of this Act:
(a) with respect to all lands which were on September 7, 1965, subject to valid
leases or permits issued under the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, ad
amended (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), or under the Mineral Leasing Act of Acquired
Lands, as amended (30 U.S.C. 351, 358), or to existing mining claims located on
or prior to September 7, 1965, the lessees or permittees or claimants of their
successors in interest who are qualified to hold geothermal leases shall have the
right to convert such lease or permits or claims to geothermal leases covering the
same lands;
(b) where there are conflicting claims, leases, or permits therefore embracing
the same land, the person who first was issued a lease or permit, who first
recorded the mining claim shall be entitled to first consideration;
(c) with respect to all lands which were on September 7, 1965, the subject of
application for leases or permits under the above Act, the applicants may convert
their applications to applications for geothermal leases having priorities dating
from the time of filing of such applications under such Acts;
(d) no person all be permitted to convert mineral leases, permits, applications
therefore, or mining claims for more than 10, 240 acres; and
(e) the conversion of leases, permits, and mining claims and applications for
leases and permits shall be accomplished in accordance with regulations
prescribed by the Secretary. No right to conversion to a geothermal lease shall
accrue to any person under this section unless such person shows to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary that substantial expenditures for the
explorations, development, or production of geothermal steam have been made
by the applicant who is seeking conversion, on the lands for which a lease is
sought on or adjoining, adjacent, or nearby Federal or non-Federal lands.
(f) with respect to land within any known geothermal resources area and which
are subject tot a right to conversion to a geothermal leases, such lands shall be
leased by competitive bidding: Provided, That, the competitive geothermal lease
shall be issued to the person owning the right to conversion to a geothermal lease
if he makes payment of an amount equal to the highest bona fide for the
competitive geothermal lease, plus the rental for the first year, within thirty days
after he received written notice from the Secretary of the amount of the highest
bid.
Sec.5. Geothermal leases shall provide for—
(a) a royalty of not more than 10 per centum or more than 15 per centum of the
amount of value of steam, or any other form of heat or energy derived from
production under the lease and sold or utilized by the lessee or reasonably
susceptible to sale or utilization by the lessee;
(b) a royalty of not more than 5 per centum of the value of any byproduct
derived from production under the lease and sold or utilized or reasonably
susceptible of sale or utilization by the

lessee, except that as to any byproduct which is a mineral named in section 1 of
the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181), the
rate of royalty for such mineral shall be the same as that provided in that Act and
the maximum rate of royalty for such mineral shall not exceed the maximum
royalty applicable under that Act;
(c) payment in advance of an annual rental of not less than $1 per acre or
fraction thereof for each year of the lease. If there is no well on the leased lands
capable of producing geothermal resources in commercial quantities, the failure
to pay rental on or before the anniversary date shall terminate the lease by
operation of law: Provided, however, That whenever the Secretary discovers that
the rental payment due under a lease is paid timely but the amount of the
payment is efficient because of an error or other reason and the deficiency is
nominal, as determined by the Secretary pursuant to regulations prescribed by
him, he shall notify the lessee of the deficiency and such lease shall not
automatically terminate unless the lessee fails to pay the deficiency within the
period prescribed in the notice: Provided further, That where any lease has been
terminated automatically by operation of law under this section for failure to pay
rental timely and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior
that the failure to pay timely the lease rental was justifiable or not due to a lack of
reasonable diligence, he in his judgment may reinstate the lease if –
(1) a petition for reinstatement together with the required rental, is filed
with the Secretary of the Interior; and
(2) no valid lease has been issued affecting any of the lands in the
terminated lease prior to the filing of the petition for reinstatement; and
(d) a minimum royalty of $2 per acre of fraction thereof in lieu of rental
payable at the expiration of each lease year for each producing lease,
commencing with the lease year beginning on or after the commencement of
production in commercial quantities. For the purpose of determining royalties
hereunder the value of any geothermal steam and byproduct used by the lessee
and not sold and reasonably susceptible of sale shall be determined by the
Secretary, who shall take into consideration the cost of exploration and
production and the economic value of the resource in terms of its ultimate
utilization.
Sec.6. (a) Geothermal leases shall be fore a primary term of ten years. If geothermal
steam is produced or utilized in commercial quantities within this term, such lease shall
continue for so long thereafter as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial
quantities, but such continuation shall not exceed an additional forty years.
(b) If at the end of such forty years, steam is provided or utilized in commercial
quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the lessee shall have a
preferential right to renewal of such lease for a second forty-year term in accordance with
such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate.
(c) Any lease for land on which, or for which under an approved cooperative or unit
plan of development or operation, actual drilling

than thirty-five year, as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial
quantities. If, at the end of such extended term, steam is being produced or utilized in
commercial quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the lessee shall
have a preferential right to a renewal of such lease for a second term in accordance with
such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate.
(d) For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, production or utilization of
geothermal steam in commercial quantities shall be deemed to include the completion of
one or more wells producing or capable of producing geothermal steam in commercial
quantities and a bona fide sale of such geothermal steam for delivery to or utilization by a
facility or facilities not yet installed but schedule for installation not later than fifteen
years from the date of commencement of the primary term of the lease.
(e) Leases which have extended by reasons of production, or which have produced
geothermal steam, and have been determined by the Secretary to be incapable of further
commercial production and utilization of geothermal steam may be further extended for a
period of not more than five years from the date of such determination but only for so
long as one or more valuable byproducts are produced in commercial quantities. If such
byproducts are leasable under the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands (30 U.S.C.
351-358), and the leasehold is primarily valuable for the production thereof, the lessee
shall be entitled to convert his geothermal lease to a mineral lease under, a subject to all
the terms and conditions of, such appropriate Act upon application at any time before
expiration of the lease extension by reason of byproduct production. The lessee shall be
entitled to locate under the mining laws all minerals which are not leasable and which
would constitute a byproduct if commercial production or utilization of geothermal steam
continued. Any such converted lease or the surface of any mining claim located for
geothermal byproducts mineral affecting lands withdrawn or acquired in aid of a function
of a Federal department or agency, including the Department of the Interior, shall be
subject to such additional terms and conditions as may be prescribed by such department
or agency with respect to the additional operations or effects resulting from such
conversion upon adequate utilization of the lands for the purpose for which they are
administered.
(f) Minerals locatable under the mining laws of the united States in land subject to a
geothermal lease issued under the provisions of this Act which are not associated with the
geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources of such lands as defined in section
2 (c) herein shall be locatable under said mining laws in accordance with the principles of

one time, whether acquired directly from the Secretary under this Act or otherwise, any
direct or indirect interest in Federal geothermal leases in any one States exceeding twenty
thousand four hundred and eighty acres, including leases acquired under the provisions of
section 4 of this Act.
At any time after fifteen years from the effective date of this Act the Secretary, after
public hearings, may increase this maximum holding in any one State by regulations, not
to exceed fifty-one thousand two hundred acres.
Sec.8. (a) The Secretary may readjust the terms and conditions, except as otherwise
provided herein, of any geothermal lease issued under this Act at not less than ten-year
intervals beginning ten years after the date the geothermal steam is produced, as
determined by the Secretary. Each geothermal lease issued under this Act shall provide
for such readjustment. The Secretary shall give notice of any proposed readjustment of
terms and conditions, and, unless the lessee files with the Secretary objection to the
proposed terms or relinquishes the lease within thirty days after receipt of such notice, the
lessee shall conclusively be deemed to have agreed with such terms and conditions. If
the lessee files objections, and no agreement can be reached between the Secretary and
the lessee within a period of not less than sixty days, the lease may be terminated by
either part.
(b) The Secretary may readjust the rentals and royalties of any geothermal lease issued
under this Act at not less than twenty-year intervals beginning thirty-five years after the

specifying in each case the date the lands were included in such area and
(b) Geothermal resources in lands the surface of which has passed from Federal
ownership but in which the minerals have been reserved to the United States shall not be
developed or produced except under geothermal leases made pursuant to this Act. If the
Secretary of the Interior finds that such development is imminent, or that production from
a well heretofore drilled on such lands is imminent, he shall so report to the Attorney
General, and the Attorney General is authorized and directed to institute an appropriate
proceedings in the United States district court of the district in which such lands are
located, to quite the title of the United States in such resources, and if the court
determines that the reservation of minerals to the United States in the lands involved
included the geothermal resources, to enjoin their production otherwise than under the
terms of this Act: Provided, That upon an authoritative judicial determination that federal
mineral reservation does not include geothermal steam and associated geothermal
resources the duties of the Secretary of the Interior to report and of the Attorney General
to institute proceedings, as hereinbefore set forth shall cease.

“(c) (1) Where the surface of all of the Federal lands involved in a proposed right-of-
way or permit is under the jurisdiction of one Federal agency, the agency head, rather
than the Secretary, is authorized to grant or renew the right-of-way or permit for the
purposes set forth in this section.
“(2) Where the surface of the Federal lands involved is administered by the Secretary
or by two or more Federal agencies, the Secretary is authorized, after consultation with
the agencies involved, to grant or renew rights-of-way or permits through the Federal
lands involved. The Secretary may enter into interagency agreements with all other
Federal agencies having jurisdiction over Federal lands for the purpose of avoiding

Sec.3. The last sentence of section 2(a) of the Mineral Land Leasing Act (30 U.S.C.
201 (a)) is amended to read as follows:
“(2) (A) The Secretary shall not issue a lease or leases under the terms of this Act to
any person, association, or corporation, o any subsidiary, affiliate, or persons controlled
by or under common control with such person, association, or corporation, where any
such entity holds a lease or leases issued by the United States to coal deposits and has
held such lease or leases for a period of ten years when such entity is not, except as
provided for in section 7 (b) of this Act, producing coal from a lease deposits in
commercial quantities. In computing the ten-year period referred to in the proceeding
sentence, periods of time prior to the date or enactment of the Federal Cal Leasing
Amendments Act of 1975 shall not be counted.
“(B) Any lease proposal which permits surface coal mining within the boundaries of a
National Forest which the Secretary proposes to issue under this Act shall be submitted to
the Governor of each State within which the coal deposits subject to such lease are
located. No such lease may be issued under this Act before the expiration of the sixty-
day period beginning on the date of such submission. If any Governor to whom a
proposed lease was submitted under this subparagraph objects to the issuance of such
lease, such lease shall not be issued before the expiration of the six-month period
beginning on the date the Secretary is notified by the Governor of such objection. During
such sex-month period, the Governor may submit to the Secretary a statement of reasons
why such lease should not be issued and the Secretary shall, on the basis of such
statement, reconsider the issuance of such lease.
“(3) (A) (i) No lease sale be held unless the lands containing the coal deposits have
been included in a comprehensive land-use plan and such sale is compatible with such
plan. The Secretary of the Interior shall prepare such land-use plans on lands under his
responsibility where such plans have not been previously prepared. The Secretary of the
Interior shall inform the Secretary of Agriculture of substantial development interest in
coal leasing on lands within the National Forest System. Upon receipt of such
notification from the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture shall prepare a
comprehensive land-use plan for such areas where such plans have not been previously
prepared. The plan of the Secretary of Agriculture shall take into consideration the
proposed coal development in these lands: Provided, That where the Secretary of the
Interior finds that because of non-Federal interest in the surface or because the coal
resources are insufficient to justify the preparation cost of a Federal containing the coal
deposits have been included in either a comprehensive land-use plan prepared by the
State within which the lands are located or a land use analysis prepared by the Secretary
of the Interior.
“(ii) In preparing such lands-use plans, the Secretary of the Interior, in the case of
lands within the National Forest system, the Secretary of Agriculture, or in the case of a
finding by the Secretary of the Interior that because of non-Federal interests in the surface
of insufficient Federal coal, no Federal comprehensive land-use plans can be
appropriately prepared, the responsible State entity shall consult with appropriate State
agencies and local governments and the general proposed plans prior to their adoption, if
request by any person having an interest which is, or may be, adversely affected by the
adoption of such plans.

“(iii) Leases covering lands the surface of which is under the jurisdiction of any
Federal agency other than the Department of the Interior may be issued only upon
consent of the other Federal agency and upon such conditions as it may prescribe with

amount of such coal which is recoverable by deep mining operations and the amount of
such coal which is recoverable by surface mining operations.
“(C) Prior to issuance of any coal lease, the Secretary shall consider effects which
mining of the proposed lease might have on an impacted community or area, including,
but not limited to, impacts on the environment, on agricultural and other economic
activities, and on public services. Prior to issuance of a lease, the Secretary shall evaluate
and compare the effects of recovering coal by deep mining, by surface mining, and by
nay other method to determine which method or methods or sequence of methods
achieves the maximum economic recovery of the coal within the proposed leasing tract.
This evaluation and comparison by the Secretary shall be in writing but shall not prohibit
the issuance of a lease; however, no mining operating plan shall be approved which is not
found to achieve the maximum economic recovery of the coal within the tract. Public
hearings in the area shall be held by the Secretary prior to the lease sale.
“(D) No lease sale shall be held until after the notice of the proposed offering for lease
has been given once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county in which the lands are situated in accordance with regulations
prescribed by the Secretary.
“(E) Each coal lease shall contain provisions requiring compliance with the Federal

person an exploration license. No person may conduct coal exploration for commercial
purpose for any coal on lands subject to this Act without such an exploration license.
Each exploration license shall be for a term of not more than two years and shall be
subject to a reasonable fee. An exploration license shall confer no right to a lease under
this Act. The issuance of exploration licenses shall not preclude the Secretary from
issuing coal leases at such times and locations and to such persons as he deems
appropriate. No exploration license will be issued for any land on which a coal lease has
been issued. A separate exploration license will be required for exploration in each State.
An application for an exploration license shall identify general areas and probable
methods of exploration. Each exploration license shall contain such reasonable
conditions as the Secretary may require, including conditions to insure the protection of
the environment, and shall be subject to all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and
regulations. Upon violation of any such conditions or laws the Secretary may revoke the
exploration license.
“(2) A license may not cause substantial disturbance to the natural land surface. He
may not remove any coal for sale but may remove reasonable amount of coal from the
lands subject to this Act included under his license for analysis and study. A
license must comply with all applicable rules and regulations for the Federal
agency having jurisdiction over the surface of the lands subject to this Act.

(b) Section 2 of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act is amended by the addition of the
following new subsection at the end thereof:
“(d) (1) The Secretary, upon determining that maximum economic recovery of the coal
deposit or deposits is served thereby, may approve the consolidation of coal leases into a
logical mining unit. Such consolidation may only take place after a public hearing, if
request by any person whose interest is or may be adversely affected. A logical mining
unit is an area of land in which the coal resources can be developed in an efficient,
economical, and orderly manner as a unit with due regard to conservation of coal reserves
and other resources. A logical mining unit consist of one or more Federal leaseholds,
and may include interviewing or adjacent lands in which the untied States does not own
the coal resources, but all the land in a logical mining unit must be under the effective
control of a single operator, be able to be developed and operated as a single operation
and be contiguous.
“(2) After the Secretary has approved the establishment of a logical mining unit any
mining plan approved for that unit must require such diligent development, operation,
and production that the reserves of the entire unit will be mined within a period
established by the Secretary which shall not be more than forty years.
“(3) In approving a logical miming unit, the Secretary may provide, among other
things, that (i) diligent development continuous operations, and production on any
Federal lease or non-federal land in the lease in that logical mining unit, and (ii) the
rentals and royalties for all Federal leases in a logical miming unit may be combined, and
advanced royalties paid for any lease within a logical mining unit may be credited against
such combined royalties.
“(4) Leases issued before the sate of enactment of this act may be included with the
consent of all lessees in such logical mining unit, and if, so included, shall be subject to
the provisions of this section.
“(5) Leases issued before the date of enactment of this Act may be included with the
consent of all lessees in such logical mining unit, and, if so included shall be subject to
the provisions of this section.
“(6) By regulation the Secretary may require a lessee under this Act to form a
logical miming unit, and may provide for determination for participating acreage
within a unit.

“(7) No logical mining unit shall be approved by the Secretary if the total acreage
(both Federal and non-Federal) of the unit would exceed twenty-five thousand acres.
“(8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to waive the acreage limitations for coal
leases contained in section 27(a) of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 184 (a)).”.
Sec.6. Section 7 of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 207) is amended to read
as follows:
“Sec.7. (a) A coal lease shall be fore a term of twenty years and for so long thereafter
as coal is produced annually in commercial quantities from that lease. Any lease which is
not producing in commercial quantities at the end of ten years shall be terminated. The
Secretary shall be regulation prescribe annual rental on lease. A lease shall require
payment of a royalty in such amounts as the Secretary shall determine of not less than 12
½ per centum of the value of coal as defined by regulations, except the Secretary may
determine a lesser amount in the case of coal recovered by underground mining
operations. The lease shall include such other terms and conditions as the Secretary shall
determine. Such rentals and royalties and other terms and conditions of the lease will be
subject to readjustment at the end of its primary term of twenty years and at the end of
each ten-year period thereafter if the lease is extended.
“(b) Each lease shall be subject to the conditions of diligent development and
continued operation of the mine or mines, except where operations under the lease are
interrupted by strikes, the elements, or casualties not attributable to the lessee. The
Secretary of the Interior, upon determining that the public interest will be served thereby,
may suspend the condition of continued operation upon the payment of advance royalties.
Such advance royalties shall be no less than production royalty which would otherwise be
paid and shall be computed on a fixed reserve to production ration (determined by the
Secretary). The aggregate number of years during the period of any lease for which
advance royalties may be accepted in lieu of the condition of continued operation shall
not exceed ten. The amount of any production royalty paid for any year shall be reduced
(but not below 0) by the amount of any advance royalties paid under such lease to the
extent that such advance royalties have not been used to reduce production royalties for a
prior year. No advance royalty paid during the initial twenty-year term of a lease shall be
used to reduce a production royalty after the twentieth year of a lease. The Secretary
may, upon six months’ notification to the lessee cease to accept advance royalties in lieu
of the requirement of continued operation. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
in affect the requirement contained in the second sentence of subsection (a) relating to
commencement of production at the end of ten years.
“(c) Prior to taking any action on a leasehold which might cause a significant
disturbance of the environment, and not later than three years after a lease is issued, the
lessee shall submit for the Secretary’s approval an operation and reclamation plan. The
Secretary shall approve or disapprove the plan or require that it be modified. Where the
land involved is under the surface jurisdiction of another Federal agency, that other
agencies must consent to the terms of such approval.”.
Sec.7. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act is amended by inserting after section 8 the
following new section 8A:
“Sec.8A. (a) The Secretary is authorized and direct to conduct a comprehensive
