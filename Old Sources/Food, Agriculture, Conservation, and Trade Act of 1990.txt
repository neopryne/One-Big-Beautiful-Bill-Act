modities, efficiency, location, regulatory compliance costs, bonding
requirements, and impact of user fees as determined by the Sec-
retary, except that the rates paid to producers and commercial
warehouse shall be established at rates that will result in no in-
crease in current or projected combined outlays of the Commodity

SEC. 1999B. ø7 U.S.C. 6401¿ FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
(1) fluid milk products are basic foods and are a primary
source of required nutrients such as calcium, and otherwise are
a valuable part of the human diet;
(2) fluid milk products must be readily available and mar-
keted efficiently to ensure that the people of the United States
receive adequate nourishment;
(3) the dairy industry plays a significant role in the econ-
omy of the United States, in that milk is produced by thou-
sands of milk producers and dairy products (including fluid
milk products) are consumed every day by millions of people in
the United States;
(4) the processing of milk into fluid milk products and the
marketing of such products are important to the dairy industry
because the fluid milk segment of the dairy market contributes
substantially to ensuring that the prices paid to milk producers
for raw milk are stable and adequate to maintain the overall
strength of the dairy industry;
(5) the maintenance and expansion of markets for fluid
milk products are vital to the Nation’s fluid milk processors
and milk producers, as well as to the general economy of the
United States;
(6) the congressional purpose underlying this subtitle is to
maintain and expand markets for fluid milk products, not to
maintain or expand any processor’s share of those markets and
that the subtitle does not prohibit or restrict individual adver-
tising or promotion of fluid milk products since the programs
created and funded by this subtitle are not extended to replace
individual advertising and promotion efforts;
(7) the cooperative development, financing, and implemen-
tation of a coordinated program of advertising and promotion
of fluid milk products is necessary to maintain and expand
markets for fluid milk products;
(8) it is appropriate to finance the cooperative program de-
scribed in paragraph (6) with self-help assessments paid by the
fluid milk processors; and
(9) fluid milk products move in interstate and foreign com-
merce, and fluid milk products that do not move in such chan-
nels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce
in fluid milk products.
(b) POLICY.—It is declared to be the policy of Congress that it
is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the
exercise of powers provided in this subtitle, of an orderly procedure
for developing, financing, through adequate assessments on fluid
milk products produced in the United States and carrying out an
effective, continuous, and coordinated program of promotion, re-
search, and consumer information designed to strengthen the posi-
tion of the dairy industry in the marketplace and maintain and ex-
pand domestic and foreign markets and uses for fluid milk prod-
ucts, the purpose of which is not to compete with or replace indi-
vidual advertising or promotion efforts designed to promote indi-
vidual brand name or trade name fluid milk products, but rather
to maintain and expand the markets for all fluid milk products,

total quantity of the crop that the producers are able
to harvest.
(ii) APPLICATION OF PARAGRAPH.—This paragraph
shall not apply in the case of a replacement crop.
(4) EXCLUSIONS FROM HARVESTED QUANTITIES.—For pur-
poses of determining the total quantity of the 1990 nonpro-
gram crop of the commodity that the producers on a farm are
able to harvest under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ex-
clude— (A) commodities that cannot be sold in normal com-
mercial channels of trade; and
(B) dockage, including husks and shells, if such dock-
age is excluded in determining yields under subsection
(d)(2).
(b) PREVENTED PLANTING CREDIT.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall provide prevented
planting credit under subsection (a) with respect to acreage
that producers on a farm were prevented from planting to the
1990 crop of the commodity for harvest because of damaging
weather or related condition in 1989 or 1990, as determined by
the Secretary.
(2) MAXIMUM ACREAGE.—Such acreage may not exceed the
greater of—
(A) a quantity equal to the acreage on the farm plant-
ed (or prevented from being planted due to a natural dis-
aster or other condition beyond the control of the pro-
ducers) to the commodity for harvest in 1989 minus acre-
age actually planted for harvest in 1990; or
(B) a quantity equal to the average of the acreage on
the farm planted (or prevented from being planted due to
a natural disaster or other condition beyond the control of
the producers) to the commodity for harvest in 1987, 1988,
and 1989 minus acreage actually planted to the commodity
for harvest in 1990.
(3) ADJUSTMENTS.—The Secretary shall make appropriate
adjustments in applying the limitations contained in para-
graph (2) to take into account crop rotation practices of the
producers.
(c) LIMITATION.—Payments provided under subsection (a) for a
crop of a commodity may not be made available to the producers
on a farm unless such producers enter into an agreement to obtain
multiperil crop insurance, to the extent required under section
2247.

available for crop year 1990), except that such term shall not
include a crop covered under section 2241, 2242, or 2243, soy-
beans, or sunflowers.
(2) FARM YIELDS.—
(A) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Commodity Credit Corpora-
tion shall establish disaster program farm yields for non-
program crops to carry out this section.
(B) PROVEN YIELDS AVAILABLE.—If the producers on a
farm can provide satisfactory evidence to the Commodity
Credit Corporation of actual crop yields on the farm for at
least 1 of the immediately preceding 3 crop years, the yield
for the farm shall be based on such proven yield.
(C) PROVEN YIELDS NOT AVAILABLE.—If such data do
not exist for any of the 3 preceding crop years, the Com-
modity Credit Corporation shall establish a yield for the
farm by using a county average yield for the commodity,
or by using other data available to it.
(D) COUNTY AVERAGE YIELDS.—In establishing county
average yields for nonprogram crops, the Commodity Cred-
it Corporation shall use the best available information con-
cerning yields. Such information may include extension
service records, credible nongovernmental studies, and
yields in similar counties.
(3) RESPONSIBILITY OF PRODUCERS.—It shall be the respon-
sibility of the producers of nonprogram crops to provide satis-
factory evidence of 1990 crop losses resulting from damaging
weather or related condition in 1989 or 1990 in order for such
producers to obtain disaster payments under this section.
SEC. 2245. CROP QUALITY REDUCTION DISASTER PAYMENTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—To ensure that all producers of 1990 crops
covered under sections 2241 through 2244 are treated equitably,
the Secretary of Agriculture may make additional disaster pay-
ments to producers of such crops who suffer losses resulting from
the reduced quality of such crops caused by damaging weather or
related condition in 1989 or 1990, as determined by the Secretary.
(b) ELIGIBLE PRODUCERS.—If the Secretary determines to make
crop quality disaster payments available to producers under sub-
section (a), producers on a farm of a crop described in subsection
(a) shall be eligible to receive reduced quality disaster payments
only if such producers incur a deficiency in production of not less
than 35 percent and not more than 75 percent for such crop (as de-
termined under section 2241, 2242, 2243, or 2244, as appropriate).
(c) MAXIMUM PAYMENT RATE.—The Secretary shall establish
the reduced quality disaster payment rate, except that such rate
shall not exceed 10 percent, as determined by the Secretary, of—
(1) the established price for the crop, for commodities cov-
ered under section 2241;
(2) the basic county loan rate for the crop (or a comparable
price if there is no current basic county loan rate), for commod-
ities covered under section 2242;
(3) the payment level under section 2243(a)(3), for com-
modities covered by section 2243; and

(4) the payment level under section 2244(a)(2), for com-
modities covered under section 2244.
(d) DETERMINATION OF PAYMENT.—The amount of payment to
a producer under this section shall be determined by multiplying
the payment rate established under subsection (c) by the portion of
the actual harvested crop on the producer’s farm that is reduced
in quality by such natural disaster in 1989 or 1990, as determined
by the Secretary.
SEC. 2246. EFFECT OF FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE PAYMENTS.
In the case of producers on a farm who obtained crop insurance
for the 1990 crop of a commodity under the Federal Crop Insurance
Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), the Secretary of Agriculture shall re-
duce the amount of payments made available under this chapter
for such crop to the extent that the amount determined by adding
the net amount of crop insurance indemnity payment (gross indem-
nity less premium paid) received by such producers for the defi-
ciency in the production of the crop and the disaster payment de-
termined in accordance with this chapter for such crop exceeds the
amount determined by multiplying—
(1) 100 percent of the yield used for the calculation of dis-
aster payments made under this chapter for such crop; by
(2) the sum of the acreage of such crop planted to harvest
and the acreage for which prevented planting credit is ap-
proved by the Secretary (or, in the case of disaster payments
under section 2241, the eligible acreage established under sec-
tions 2241(a)(1) and 2241(a)(2)(A)); by
(3)(A) in the case of producers who participated in a pro-
duction adjustment program for the 1990 crop of wheat, feed
grains, upland cotton, extra long staple cotton, or rice, the es-
tablished price for the 1990 crop of the commodity;
(B) in the case of producers who did not participate in a
production adjustment program for the 1990 crop of wheat,
feed grains, upland cotton, extra long staple cotton, or rice, the
basic county loan rate (or a comparable price, as determined by
the Secretary, if there is no current basic county loan rate) for
the 1990 crop of the commodity;
(C) in the case of producers of sugar beets, sugarcane, pea-
nuts, or tobacco, the payment level for the commodity estab-
lished under section 2243(a)(3); and
(D) in the case of producers of soybeans or a nonprogram
crop (as defined in section 2244(d)(1)), the simple average price
received by producers of the commodity, as determined by the
Secretary, during the marketing years for the immediately pre-
ceding 5 crops of the commodity, excluding the year in which
the average price was the highest and the year in which the
average price was the lowest in such period.
SEC. 2247. CROP INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE 1991 CROPS.
(a) REQUIREMENT.—Subject to the limitations under subsection

multiperil crop insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7
U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) for the 1991 crop of the commodity for which
such payments, loans, or forgiveness are sought.
(b) LIMITATIONS.—Producers on a farm shall not be required to
agree to obtain crop insurance under subsection (a) for a com-
modity—
(1) unless such producers’ deficiency in production, with
respect to the crop for which a disaster payment under this
chapter otherwise may be made, exceeds 65 percent;
(2) where, or if, crop insurance coverage is not available to
the producers for the commodity for which the payment, loan,
or forgiveness is sought;
(3) if the producers’ annual premium rate for such crop in-
surance is an amount greater than 125 percent of the average
premium rate for insurance on that commodity for the 1990
crop in the county in which the producers are located;
(4) in any case in which the producers’ annual premium
for such crop insurance is an amount greater than 25 percent
of the amount of the payment, loan, or forgiveness sought; or
(5) if the producers can establish by appeal to the county
committee established under section 8(b) of the Soil Conserva-
tion and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590(b)), or to the
county committee established under section 332 of the Consoli-
dated Farm and Rural Development Act (17 U.S.C. 1982), as
appropriate, that the purchase of crop insurance would impose
an undue financial hardship on such producers and that a
waiver of the requirement to obtain crop insurance should, in
the discretion of the county committee, be granted.
(c) IMPLEMENTATION.—
(1) COUNTY COMMITTEES.—The Secretary of Agriculture
shall ensure (acting through the county committees established

for assistance, as described in subsection (a), obtain multiperil
crop insurance as required under this section.
(2) OTHER SOURCES.—Each producer who is subject to the
requirements of this section may comply with such require-
ments by providing evidence of multiperil crop insurance cov-
erage from sources other than through the county committee
office, as approved by the Secretary.
(3) COMMISSIONS.—The Secretary shall provide by regula-
tion for a reduction in the commissions paid to private insur-
ance agents, brokers, or companies on crop insurance contracts
entered into under this section sufficient to reflect that such
insurance contracts principally involve only a servicing func-
tion to be performed by the agent, broker, or company.
(d) REPAYMENT OF BENEFITS.—Notwithstanding any other pro-
vision of law, if (prior to the end of the 1991 crop year for the com-

(2) the economic well-being of many rural communities de-
pends upon the goods and services that are derived from Na-
tional Forest System land;
(3) the economies of many of these communities suffer
from a lack of industrial and business diversity;
(4) this lack of diversity is particularly serious in commu-
nities whose economies are predominantly dependent on tim-
ber and recreation resources and where management decisions
made on National Forest System land by Federal and private
organizations may disrupt the supply of those resources;
(5) the Forest Service has expertise and resources that
could be directed to promote modernization and economic di-
versification of existing industries and services based on nat-
ural resources;
(6) the Forest Service has the technical expertise to pro-
vide leadership, in cooperation with other governmental agen-
cies and the private sector, to assist rural communities depend-
ent upon National Forest System land resources to upgrade ex-
isting industries and diversify by developing new economic ac-
tivity in non-forest-related industries; and
(7) technical assistance, training, education, and other as-
sistance provided by the Department of Agriculture can be tar-
geted to provide immediate help to those rural communities in
greatest need.
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this chapter are—
(1) to provide assistance to rural communities that are lo-
cated in or near National Forest System land and that are eco-
nomically dependent upon natural resources or are likely to be
economically disadvantaged by Federal or private sector land
management practices;
(2) to aid in diversifying such communities’ economic
bases; and
(3) to improve the economic, social, and environmental
well-being of rural America.
