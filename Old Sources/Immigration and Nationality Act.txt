States and Ukraine, and between the United States and the other independent states of the
former Soviet Union.
(b) E XTENT OF S UCH P ROVISIONS.—Many of the provisions referred to in subsection (a) im-
posed limitations specifically with respect to the Soviet Union, and its constituent republics, or
utilized language that reflected the tension that existed between the United States and the So-
viet Union at the time of their enactment. Other such provisions did not refer specifically to
the Soviet Union, but nonetheless were directed (or may be construed as having been directed)
against the Soviet Union on the basis of the relations that formerly existed between the United
States and the Soviet Union, particularly in its role as the leading communist country.

Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and

tarian dictatorship or totalitarianism. The terms ‘‘totalitarian dicta-
torship’’ and ‘‘totalitarianism’’ mean and refer to systems of govern-
ment not representative in fact, characterized by (A) the existence
of a single political party, organized on a dictatorial basis, with so
close an identity between such party and its policies and the gov-
ernmental policies of the country in which it exists, that the party
and the government constitute an indistinguishable unit, and (B)
the forcible suppression of opposition to such party.

empts such adjustment from the numerical limitation on the

and Nationality Act shall be considered to have been granted with respect to Taiwan (China).
On Apr. 30, 1979, the Department of State made a final ruling whereby 22 CFR Part 42 was
amended effective Apr. 23, 1979, to provide that aliens in Taiwan applying for immigrant visas
shall be required to appear personally before a designated officer of the American Institute in
Taiwan in connection with the execution of his immigrant visa application. This ruling, which
was made pursuant to the authority contained in section 104 of the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act, can be found at 44 F.R. 28659, May 16, 1979.

with respect to Hong Kong as a separate foreign state, and not as a colony or other component
or dependent area of another foreign state, except that the total number of immigrant visas

state specified by the Secretary of State. For the purposes of this
Act the foreign state to which an immigrant is chargeable shall be
determined by birth within such foreign state except that (1) an
alien child, when accompanied by or following to join his alien par-
ent or parents, may be charged to the foreign state of either parent
if such parent has received or would be qualified for an immigrant
visa, if necessary to prevent the separation of the child from the
parent or parents, and if immigration charged to the foreign state
to which such parent has been or would be chargeable has not
reached a numerical level established under subsection (a)(2) for
that fiscal year; (2) if an alien is chargeable to a different foreign
state from that of his spouse, the foreign state to which such alien
is chargeable may, if necessary to prevent the separation of hus-
band and wife, be determined by the foreign state of the spouse he
is accompanying or following to join, if such spouse has received or
would be qualified for an immigrant visa and if immigration
charged to the foreign state to which such spouse has been or
would be chargeable has not reached a numerical level established
under subsection (a)(2) for that fiscal year; (3) an alien born in the
United States shall be considered as having been born in the coun-
try of which he is a citizen or subject, or, if he is not a citizen or
subject of any country, in the last foreign country in which he had
his residence as determined by the consular officer; and (4) an alien
born within any foreign state in which neither of his parents was
born and in which neither of his parents had a residence at the
time of such alien’s birth may be charged to the foreign state of ei-
ther parent.
(c) CHARGEABILITY FOR DEPENDENT AREAS.—Any immigrant
born in a colony or other component or dependent area of a foreign
state overseas from the foreign state, other than an alien described
in section 201(b), shall be chargeable for the purpose of the limita-
tion set forth in subsection (a), to the foreign state.

justment of status under section 245, by an alien
physician described in subclause (I) prior to the
date by which such alien physician has completed

(IV) The requirements of this subsection do
not affect waivers on behalf of alien physicians ap-
proved under section 203(b)(2)(B) 85 before the en-
actment date of this subsection 86 . In the case of
a physician for whom an application for a waiver
was filed under section 203(b)(2)(B) 85 prior to No-
vember 1, 1998, the Attorney General shall grant
a national interest waiver pursuant to section
203(b)(2)(B) 85 except that the alien is required to
have worked full time as a physician for an aggre-
gate of 3 years (not including time served in the
status of an alien described in section
101(a)(15)(J)) before a visa can be issued to the

(b) For purposes of the pilot program established in subsection (a), beginning on October 1,

(C), (D), or (E)) of any refugee who qualifies for admission under
paragraph (1) shall, if not otherwise entitled to admission under
paragraph (1) and if not a person described in the second sentence
of section 101(a)(42), be entitled to the same admission status as
such refugee if accompanying, or following to join, such refugee and
if the spouse or child is admissible (except as otherwise provided
under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this Act. Upon the

to Congress of the number of waivers granted under this paragraph
in the previous fiscal year and a summary of the reasons for grant-
ing such waivers.

of the alien) may be terminated by the Attorney General pursuant
to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe if the

the anticipated allocation of refugee admissions during the fiscal
year. The President shall provide for periodic discussions between
designated representatives of the President and members of such
committees regarding changes in the worldwide refugee situation,
the progress of refugee admissions, and the possible need for ad-
justments in the allocation of admissions among refugees.
(2) As soon as possible after representatives of the President
initiate appropriate consultation with respect to the number of ref-
ugee admissions under subsection (a) or with respect to the admis-
sion of refugees in response to an emergency refugee situation
under subsection (b), the Committees on the Judiciary of the House
of Representatives and of the Senate shall cause to have printed
in the Congressional Record the substance of such consultation.
(3)(A) After the President initiates appropriate consultation
prior to making a determination under subsection (a), a hearing to
review the proposed determination shall be held unless public dis-
closure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or
safety of individuals.
(B) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior
to making a determination, under subsection (b), that the number
of refugee admissions should be increased because of an unforeseen
emergency refugee situation, to the extent that time and the na-
ture of the emergency refugee situation permit, a hearing to review
the proposal to increase refugee admissions shall be held unless
public disclosure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the
lives or safety of individuals.

cerns or grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the na-
tional interest, and to provide such members with the following in-
formation:

dicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of
such alien’s status, may apply for asylum in accordance with
this section or, where applicable, section 235(b).

lateral agreement, to a country (other than the country of
the alien’s nationality or, in the case of an alien having no
nationality, the country of the alien’s last habitual resi-
dence) in which the alien’s life or freedom would not be
threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, mem-
bership in a particular social group, or political opinion,
and where the alien would have access to a full and fair
procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent
temporary protection, unless the Attorney General finds
that it is in the public interest for the alien to receive asy-
lum in the United States.

graph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the alien dem-
onstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the appli-

subparagraphs (B) and (C), if the alien demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the exist-
ence of changed circumstances which materially affect the
applicant’s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary cir-
cumstances relating to the delay in filing an application
within the period specified in subparagraph (B).
(E) APPLICABILITY.—Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall
not apply to an unaccompanied alien child (as defined in
section 462(g) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6
U.S.C. 279(g))).
(3) LIMITATION ON JUDICIAL REVIEW.—No court shall have
jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney Gen-
eral under paragraph (2).
(b) CONDITIONS FOR GRANTING ASYLUM.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—
(A) ELIGIBILITY.—The Secretary of Homeland Security
or the Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien who
has applied for asylum in accordance with the require-
ments and procedures established by the Secretary of
Homeland Security or the Attorney General under this sec-
tion if the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney
General determines that such alien is a refugee within the
meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A).
(B) BURDEN OF PROOF.—
(i) I N GENERAL.—The burden of proof is on the ap-
plicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee,
within the meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A). To estab-
lish that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning
of such section, the applicant must establish that race,
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social
group, or political opinion was or will be at least one
central reason for persecuting the applicant.
(ii) SUSTAINING BURDEN.—The testimony of the
applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant’s
burden without corroboration, but only if the applicant
satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant’s testimony
is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts
sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a ref-
ugee. In determining whether the applicant has met
the applicant’s burden, the trier of fact may weigh the
credible testimony along with other evidence of record.
Where the trier of fact determines that the applicant
should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise
credible testimony, such evidence must be provided
unless the applicant does not have the evidence and
cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.
(iii) CREDIBILITY DETERMINATION.—Considering
the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant fac-
tors, a trier of fact may base a credibility determina-
tion on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the
applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the
applicant’s or witness’s account, the consistency be-
tween the applicant’s or witness’s written and oral
statements (whenever made and whether or not under

oath, and considering the circumstances under which
the statements were made), the internal consistency of
each such statement, the consistency of such state-
ments with other evidence of record (including the re-
ports of the Department of State on country condi-
tions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such
statements, without regard to whether an inconsist-
ency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the
applicant’s claim, or any other relevant factor. There
is no presumption of credibility, however, if no adverse
credibility determination is explicitly made, the appli-
cant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of
credibility on appeal.
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an
alien if the Attorney General determines that—
(i) the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise
participated in the persecution of any person on ac-

particular social group, or political opinion;
(ii) the alien, having been convicted by a final
judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a

the case only of an alien inadmissible under subclause
(IV) of section 212(a)(3)(B)(i), the Attorney General de-
termines, in the Attorney General’s discretion, that
there are not reasonable grounds for regarding the
alien as a danger to the security of the United States;
or
(vi) the alien was firmly resettled in another coun-
try prior to arriving in the United States.
(B) SPECIAL RULES.—
(i) CONVICTION OF AGGRAVATED FELONY.—For pur-
poses of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), an alien who
has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be
considered to have been convicted of a particularly se-
rious crime.
(ii) OFFENSES.—The Attorney General may des-
ignate by regulation offenses that will be considered to
be a crime described in clause (ii) or (iii) of subpara-
graph (A).

join, such alien.
(B) CONTINUED CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN ALIENS AS

this paragraph and section 209(b)(3), if the alien attained
21 years of age after such application was filed but while
it was pending.
(C) INITIAL JURISDICTION.—An asylum officer (as de-
fined in section 235(b)(1)(E)) shall have initial jurisdiction
over any asylum application filed by an unaccompanied
alien child (as defined in section 462(g) of the Homeland
Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g))), regardless of

cumstances;
(B) the alien meets a condition described in subsection
(b)(2);
(C) the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral

ual residence) in which the alien’s life or freedom would

(2) ADJUSTMENT TO PERMANENT RESIDENCE.—The Attorney
General shall adjust the status of any alien provided lawful
temporary resident status under paragraph (1) to that of an
alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on the fol-
lowing date:

porary residence under paragraph (1), that the alien per-
formed seasonal agricultural services in the United States
for at least 90 man-days during each of the 12-months pe-

(4) AUTHORIZED TRAVEL AND EMPLOYMENT DURING TEM-
PORARY RESIDENCE.—During the period an alien is in lawful
temporary resident status granted under this subsection, the
alien has the right to travel abroad (including commutation
from a residence abroad) and shall be granted authorization to
engage in employment in the United States and shall be pro-
vided an ‘‘employment authorized’’ endorsement or other ap-
propriate work permit, in the same manner as for aliens law-
fully admitted for permanent residence.
(5) IN GENERAL.—Except as otherwise provided in this sub-
section, an alien who acquires the status of an alien lawfully
admitted for temporary residence under paragraph (1), such
status not having changed, is considered to be an alien law-
fully admitted for permanent residence (as described in section
101(a)(20)), other than under any provision of the immigration
laws.
(b) APPLICATIONS FOR ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.—
(1) TO WHOM MAY BE MADE.—
(A) WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.—The Attorney Gen-
eral shall provide that applications for adjustment of sta-
tus under subsection (a) may be filed—
(i) with the Attorney General, or
(ii) with a designated entity (designated under
paragraph (2)), but only if the applicant consents to
the forwarding of the application to the Attorney Gen-
eral.
(B) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.—The Attorney Gen-
eral, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall pro-
vide a procedure whereby an alien may apply for adjust-
ment of status under subsection (a)(1) at an appropriate
consular office outside the United States. If the alien oth-
erwise qualifies for such adjustment, the Attorney General
shall provide such documentation of authorization to enter
the United States and to have the alien’s status adjusted
upon entry as may be necessary to carry out the provisions
of this section.
(2) DESIGNATION OF ENTITIES TO RECEIVE APPLICATIONS.—
For purposes of receiving applications under this section, the
Attorney General—
(A) shall designate qualified voluntary organizations
and other qualified State, local, community, farm labor or-
ganizations, and associations of agricultural employers,
and (B) may designate such other persons as the Attorney
General determines are qualified and have substantial ex-
perience, demonstrated competence, and traditional long-
term involvement in the preparation and submittal of ap-
plications for adjustment of status under section 209 or
245, Public Law 89–732, or Public Law 95–145.
(3) PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY.—

government employment records, records supplied by em-
ployers or collective bargaining organizations, and such
other reliable documentation as the alien may provide. The
Attorney General shall establish special procedures to
credit properly work in cases in which an alien was em-
ployed under an assumed name.
(B) DOCUMENTATION OF WORK HISTORY.—(i) An alien
applying for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1)
has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evi-
dence that the alien has worked the requisite number of
man-days (as required under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii)).
(ii) If an employer or farm labor contractor employing
such an alien has kept proper and adequate records re-
specting such employment, the alien’s burden of proof
under clause (i) may be met by securing timely production
of those records under regulations to be promulgated by
the Attorney General.
(iii) An alien can meet such burden of proof if the
alien establishes that the alien has in fact performed the
work described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) by producing suf-
ficient evidence to show the extent of that employment as
a matter of just and reasonable inference. In such a case,
the burden then shifts to the Attorney General to disprove
the alien’s evidence with a showing which negates the rea-
sonableness of the inference to be drawn from the evi-
dence.
(4) TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS BY DESIGNATED ENTI-
TIES.—Each designated entity must agree to forward to the At-
torney General applications filed with it in accordance with
paragraph (1)(A)(ii) but not to forward to the Attorney General
applications filed with it unless the applicant has consented to
such forwarding. No such entity may make a determination re-
quired by this section to be made by the Attorney General.
(5) LIMITATION ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION.—Files and
records prepared for purposes of this section by designated en-
tities operating under this section are confidential and the At-
torney General and the Service shall not have access to such
files or records relating to an alien without the consent of the
alien, except as allowed by a court order issued pursuant to
paragraph (6) of this subsection.
(6) CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in this para-
graph, neither the Attorney General, nor any other official
or employee of the Department of Justice, or bureau or
agency thereof, may—
(i) use the information furnished by the applicant
pursuant to an application filed under this section for
any purpose other than to make a determination on
the application, including a determination under sub-
section (a)(3)(B), or for enforcement of paragraph (7);
(ii) make any publication whereby the information
furnished by any particular individual can be identi-
fied; or

and employees of the Department or bureau or agency

shall provide information furnished under this section, and
any other information derived from such furnished infor-
mation, to a duly recognized law enforcement entity in
connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution,

tity, or to an official coroner for purposes of affirmatively
identifying a deceased individual (whether or not such in-
dividual is deceased as a result of a crime).

be construed to limit the use, or release, for immigra-
tion enforcement purposes or law enforcement pur-
poses of information contained in files or records of the
Service pertaining to an application filed under this
section, other than information furnished by an appli-
cant pursuant to the application, or any other informa-
tion derived from the application, that is not available
from any other source.
(ii) CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS.—Information con-
cerning whether the applicant has at any time been
convicted of a crime may be used or released for immi-
gration enforcement or law enforcement purposes.
(D) CRIME.—Whoever knowingly uses, publishes, or
permits information to be examined in violation of this
paragraph shall be fined not more than $10,000.
(7) PENALTIES FOR FALSE STATEMENTS IN APPLICATIONS.—
(A) CRIMINAL PENALTY.—Whoever—
(i) files an application for adjustment of status
under this section and knowingly and willfully fal-
sifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact or makes
any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or rep-
resentations, or makes or uses any false writing or
document knowing the same to contain any false, ficti-
tious, or fraudulent statement or entry, or
(ii) creates or supplies a false writing or document
for use in making such an application,
shall be fined in accordance with title 18, United States
Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

ical limitations of sections 201 and 202 shall not apply to the

bership in or affiliation with a proscribed organization but who is otherwise admissible to the
United States, recommend that the Attorney General grant the approval necessary for the
issuance of a visa to such alien, unless the Secretary determines that the admission of such
alien would be contrary to the security interests of the United States and so certifies to the
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions of the Senate. Nothing in this section may be construed as authorizing or requiring the
admission to the United States of any alien who is excludible for reasons other than member-
ship in or affiliation with a proscribed organization.
(b) This section does not apply to representatives of purported labor organizations in countries
where such organizations are in fact instruments of a totalitarian state.

subsection (a)(3)(B)(vi), and no such waiver may be extended to a
group that has engaged terrorist activity against the United States
or another democratic country or that has purposefully engaged in
a pattern or practice of terrorist activity that is directed at civil-

United States Government to commence criminal or civil pro-

other person, nor create any substantive or procedural right or ben-

vided in subparagraph (B) or in section 214(f), in his discretion pa-
role into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he
may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian
reasons or significant public benefit any alien applying for admis-

be regarded as an admission of the alien and when the purposes
of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland
Security, have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be
returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter
his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that

(B) The Secretary of Homeland Security may not parole into
the United States an alien who is a refugee unless the Secretary
of Homeland Security determines that compelling reasons in the
public interest with respect to that particular alien require that the
alien be paroled into the United States rather than be admitted as
a refugee under section 207.

officer, alleging a violation of the limitation under subparagraph
(A) that parole solely be granted on a case-by-case basis and solely

an action against the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of
such State or the residents of such State in an appropriate district
court of the United States to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.
The court shall advance on the docket and expedite the disposition
of a civil action filed under this subparagraph to the greatest ex-

residents shall be considered to have been harmed if the State or
its residents experience harm, including financial harm in excess of
$100.

residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it
has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien.

or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detri-
mental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclama-

teria which are established in coordination with the Secretary
of Health and Human Services and which take into consider-
ation the published requirements of the medical specialty
board which administers such education or training program;

case of an alien applying for admission as a nonimmigrant vis-
itor for business or pleasure and solely for entry into and stay
in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands for a period not to exceed 45 days, if the Secretary of
Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of
the Interior, the Secretary of State, the Governor of Guam and
the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, determines that—
(A) an adequate arrival and departure control system
has been developed in Guam and the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands; and
(B) such a waiver does not represent a threat to the
welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its terri-
tories and commonwealths.
(2) ALIEN WAIVER OF RIGHTS.—An alien may not be pro-
vided a waiver under this subsection unless the alien has
waived any right—

(A) to review or appeal under this Act an immigration
officer’s determination as to the admissibility of the alien
at the port of entry into Guam or the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands; or
(B) to contest, other than on the basis of an applica-
tion for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of
this Act or under the Convention Against Torture, or an
application for asylum if permitted under section 208, any
action for removal of the alien.
(3) REGULATIONS.—All necessary regulations to implement
this subsection shall be promulgated by the Secretary of Home-
land Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior
and the Secretary of State, on or before the 180th day after the
date of enactment of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act
of 2008. The promulgation of such regulations shall be consid-
ered a foreign affairs function for purposes of section 553(a) of
title 5, United States Code. At a minimum, such regulations
should include, but not necessarily be limited to—
(A) a listing of all countries whose nationals may ob-
tain the waiver also provided by this subsection, except
that such regulations shall provide for a listing of any
country from which the Commonwealth has received a sig-
nificant economic benefit from the number of visitors for
pleasure within the one-year period preceding the date of
enactment of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of
2008, unless the Secretary of Homeland Security deter-
mines that such country’s inclusion on such list would rep-
resent a threat to the welfare, safety, or security of the
United States or its territories; and
(B) any bonding requirements for nationals of some or
all of those countries who may present an increased risk
of overstays or other potential problems, if different from
such requirements otherwise provided by law for non-
immigrant visitors.
(4) FACTORS.—In determining whether to grant or continue
providing the waiver under this subsection to nationals of any
country, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State,
shall consider all factors that the Secretary deems relevant, in-
cluding electronic travel authorizations, procedures for report-
ing lost and stolen passports, repatriation of aliens, rates of re-
fusal for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, exit systems,
and information exchange.
(5) SUSPENSION.—The Secretary of Homeland Security
shall monitor the admission of nonimmigrant visitors to Guam
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
under this subsection. If the Secretary determines that such
admissions have resulted in an unacceptable number of visi-
tors from a country remaining unlawfully in Guam or the Com-
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, unlawfully ob-
taining entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking
withholding of removal or asylum, or that visitors from a coun-
try pose a risk to law enforcement or security interests of

retary shall suspend the admission of nationals of such country

may in the Secretary’s discretion suspend the Guam and
Northern Mariana Islands visa waiver program at any time, on
a country-by-country basis, for other good cause.
(6) ADDITION OF COUNTRIES.—The Governor of Guam and
the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to add a particular country to the
list of countries whose nationals may obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection, and the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity may grant such request after consultation with the Sec-
retary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, and may pro-
mulgate regulations with respect to the inclusion of that coun-
try and any special requirements the Secretary of Homeland
Security, in the Secretary’s sole discretion, may impose prior to
allowing nationals of that country to obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection.

dispute, the facility did not lay off and will not lay off a reg-
istered nurse employed by the facility within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing
of any visa petition, and the employment of such an alien is
not intended or designed to influence an election for a bar-
gaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.
(vi) At the time of the filing of the petition for registered
nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), notice of the filing has

ity; or
(II) transfer the place of employment of the alien from
one worksite to another.
Nothing 186 in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a fa-
cility to have taken significant steps described in such clause
before the date of the enactment of the Nursing Relief for Dis-
advantaged Areas Act of 1999. A copy of the attestation shall
be provided, within 30 days of the date of filing, to registered
nurses employed at the facility on the date of filing.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv), each of the following

ing program for registered nurses elsewhere.
(ii) Providing career development programs and other
methods of facilitating health care workers to become reg-
istered nurses.
(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than
currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in
the geographic area.
(iv) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful sal-
ary advancement by registered nurses.

(II) the end of the period of admission under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of the last alien with respect to whose
admission it was applied (in accordance with clause (ii));
and
(ii) shall apply to petitions filed during the one-year period
beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor
if the facility states in each such petition that it continues to
comply with the conditions in the attestation.
(D) A facility may meet the requirements under this paragraph
with respect to more than one registered nurse in a single petition.
(E)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available
for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a

cility, a copy of the facility’s attestation under subparagraph (A)
(and accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed by
the facility.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process, including
reasonable time limits, for the receipt, investigation, and disposi-
tion of complaints respecting a facility’s failure to meet conditions
attested to or a facility’s misrepresentation of a material fact in an
attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or or-
ganization (including bargaining representatives, associations
deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties
as determined under regulations of the Secretary). The Secretary
shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reason-
able cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested
to. Subject to the time limits established under this clause, this
subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether an attestation is
expired or unexpired at the time a complaint is filed.
(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within
180 days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determina-
tion as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described
in clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists,
the Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the
interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the com-
plaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.
(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that a facility (for which an attestation is made) has
failed to meet a condition attested to or that there was a misrepre-
sentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall no-
tify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, im-
pose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary
penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per nurse per viola-
tion, with the total penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation) as
the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with

(v) In addition to the sanctions provided for under clause (iv),
if the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity for
a hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to

nurses at the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the
facility to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may
be required to comply with such condition.
(F)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall impose on a facility filing
an attestation under subparagraph (A) a filing fee, in an amount
prescribed by the Secretary based on the costs of carrying out the

retary of Labor, to the extent and in such amounts as may be pro-
vided in appropriations Acts, to cover the costs described in clause
(i), in addition to any other funds that are available to the Sec-
retary to cover such costs.

year shall not exceed 500. The number of such visas issued for em-
ployment in each State in each fiscal year shall not exceed the fol-
lowing:
(A) For States with populations of less than 9,000,000,
based upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 25 visas.

nonimmigrants who may be issued such visas during those
quarters, the visas made available under this paragraph shall

subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph during the last fiscal
year quarter.
(5) A facility that has filed a petition under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) to employ a nonimmigrant to perform nursing
services for the facility—
(A) shall provide the nonimmigrant a wage rate and work-
ing conditions commensurate with those of nurses similarly

ments of 1991 (P.L. 102–232, Dec. 12, 1991, 105 Stat. 1747), effective as if included in the Immi-
gration Act of 1990. Paragraph (8) of § 303(a) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration
and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (P.L. 102–232, Dec. 12, 1991, 105 Stat. 1748) provides
as follows:
(8) The Secretary of Labor shall issue final or interim final regulations to implement the
changes made by this section to section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) and section 212(n) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act no later than January 2, 1992.

ments:
(A) As of March 31, 1997, the hospital was located in a
health professional shortage area (as defined in section 332 of
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e)).
(B) Based on its settled cost report filed under title XVIII
of the Social Security Act for its cost reporting period begin-
ning during fiscal year 1994—
(i) the hospital has not less than 190 licensed acute
care beds;
(ii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for
such period which were made up of patients who (for such
days) were entitled to benefits under part A of such title
is not less than 35 percent of the total number of such hos-
pital’s acute care inpatient days for such period; and
(iii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for
such period which were made up of patients who (for such
days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State
plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act,
is not less than 28 percent of the total number of such hos-
pital’s acute care inpatient days for such period.
(7) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(v), the term ‘‘lay off’’,
with respect to a worker—
(A) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(B) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit an employee’s
or an employer’s rights under a collective bargaining agree-
ment or other employment contract.

(I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to
all other individuals with similar experience and
qualifications for the specific employment in question,
or (II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
classification in the area of employment,
whichever is greater, based on the best information avail-
able as of the time of filing the application, and
(ii) will provide working conditions for such a non-
immigrant that will not adversely affect the working condi-
tions of workers similarly employed.
(B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute in the occupational classification at the place of em-
ployment.
(C) The employer, at the time of filing the application—
(i) has provided notice of the filing under this para-
graph to the bargaining representative (if any) of the em-
ployer’s employees in the occupational classification and
area for which aliens are sought, or
(ii) if there is no such bargaining representative, has
provided notice of filing in the occupational classification
through such methods as physical posting in conspicuous
locations at the place of employment or electronic notifica-
tion to employees in the occupational classification for
which H–1B nonimmigrants are sought.
(D) The application shall contain a specification of the
number of workers sought, the occupational classification in
which the workers will be employed, and wage rate and condi-
tions under which they will be employed.
(E)(i) In the case of an application described in clause (ii),
the employer did not displace and will not displace a United
States worker (as defined in paragraph (4)) employed by the
employer within the period beginning 90 days before and end-
ing 90 days after the date of filing of any visa petition sup-
ported by the application.
(ii) An application described in this clause is an application
filed on or after the date final regulations are first promul-
gated to carry out this subparagraph, and before by 188 an H–
1B-dependent employer (as defined in paragraph (3)) or by an
employer that has been found, on or after the date of the en-
actment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Im-

committed a willful failure or misrepresentation during the 5-
year period preceding the filing of the application. An applica-
tion is not described in this clause if the only H–1B non-
immigrants sought in the application are exempt H–1B non-
immigrants.

(i) the nonimmigrant performs duties in whole or in
part at one or more worksites owned, operated, or con-
trolled by such other employer; and
(ii) there are indicia of an employment relationship be-
tween the nonimmigrant and such other employer;
unless the employer has inquired of the other employer as to
whether, and has no knowledge that, within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of the
placement of the nonimmigrant with the other employer, the
other employer has displaced or intends to displace a United
States worker employed by the other employer.
(G)(i) In the case of an application described in subpara-
graph (E)(ii), subject to clause (ii), the employer, prior to filing
the application—
(I) has taken good faith steps to recruit, in the United
States using procedures that meet industry-wide standards
and offering compensation that is at least as great as that
required to be offered to H–1B nonimmigrants under sub-
paragraph (A), United States workers for the job for which
the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought; and
(II) has offered the job to any United States worker
who applies and is equally or better qualified for the job
for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are
sought.
(ii) The conditions described in clause (i) shall not apply to
an application filed with respect to the employment of an H–
1B nonimmigrant who is described in subparagraph (A), (B), or
(C) of section 203(b)(1).
The employer shall make available for public examination, within
one working day after the date on which an application under this
paragraph is filed, at the employer’s principal place of business or
worksite, a copy of each such application (and such accompanying
documents as are necessary). The Secretary shall compile, on a cur-
rent basis, a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of
the applications filed under this subsection. Such list shall include
the wage rate, number of aliens sought, period of intended employ-
ment, and date of need. The Secretary shall make such list avail-
able for public examination in Washington, D.C. The Secretary of
Labor shall review such an application only for completeness and
obvious inaccuracies. Unless the Secretary finds that the applica-
tion is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary shall pro-
vide the certification described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) within
7 days of the date of the filing of the application. The application
form shall include a clear statement explaining the liability under
subparagraph (F) of a placing employer if the other employer de-
scribed in such subparagraph displaces a United States worker as
described in such subparagraph. Nothing in subparagraph (G) shall
be construed to prohibit an employer from using legitimate selec-
tion criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary to the
type of job involved, so long as such criteria are not applied in a
discriminatory manner.

plaints respecting a petitioner’s failure to meet a condition specified

in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a petitioner’s
misrepresentation of material facts in such an application. Com-
plaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (in-
cluding bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing
shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or mis-
representation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12
months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respec-
tively. The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this
paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure
or misrepresentation has occurred.
(B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding
described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that
such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for no-
tice of such determination to the interested parties and an oppor-
tunity for a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section
556 of title 5, United States Code, within 60 days after the date
of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary
shall make a finding concerning the matter by not later than 60
days after the date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints
respecting the same applicant, the Secretary may consolidate the
hearings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(B), (1)(E),
or (1)(F), a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph
(1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(G)(i)(I), or a misrepresentation of material fact
in an application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 1 year for aliens to be employed by the
employer.
(ii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1), a
willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, or a
violation of clause (iv)—

finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not

(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not

(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 3 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, re-
strain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discrimi-
nate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause,
includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) be-
cause the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evi-
dences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation per-
taining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or
seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding con-
cerning the employer’s compliance with the requirements of this
subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General shall de-
vise a process under which an H–1B nonimmigrant who files a
complaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligi-
ble to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to
seek other appropriate employment in the United States for a pe-
riod not to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such
nonimmigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has
filed an application under this subsection to require an H–1B non-
immigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the em-
ployer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the em-
ployer. The Secretary shall determine whether a required payment
is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant
State law.
(II) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an alien who is the
subject of a petition filed under section 214(c)(1), for which a fee
is imposed under section 214(c)(9), to reimburse, or otherwise com-
pensate, the employer for part or all of the cost of such fee. It is
a violation of this clause for such an employer otherwise to accept
such reimbursement or compensation from such an alien.
(III) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this clause,
the Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000 for
each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the
return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this
clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring pay-
ment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.

and who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a full-time
employee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the em-
ployer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant
has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as
lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant’s lack of a permit or li-
cense, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages in accord-
ance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection
and who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a part-time
employee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the em-
ployer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant
has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
status under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay
such a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on such pe-
tition consistent with the rate of pay identified on such petition.
(III) In the case of an H–1B nonimmigrant who has not yet en-
tered into employment with an employer who has had approved an
application under this subsection, and a petition under section
214(c)(1), with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of sub-
clauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days
after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into the United
States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after the date the non-
immigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer (in the case
of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the date
of the approval of the petition).
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to an
H–1B nonimmigrant for nonproductive time due to non-work-re-
lated factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant
for an absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant un-
able to work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an em-
ployer that is a school or other educational institution from apply-
ing to an H–1B nonimmigrant an established salary practice of the
employer, under which the employer pays to H–1B nonimmigrants
and United States workers in the same occupational classification
an annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual
salary payments prior to the commencement of the employ-
ment; and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for

fail to offer to an H–1B nonimmigrant, during the nonimmigrant’s

(G)(i) If the Secretary receives specific credible information from a source, who is likely to
have knowledge of an employer’s practices or employment conditions, or an employer’s compli-
ance with the employer’s labor condition application under paragraph (1), and whose identity
is known to the Secretary, and such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the
employer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(E),
(1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet such a condition,
or has committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that affects multiple employees,
the Secretary may conduct a 30-day investigation into the alleged failure or failures. The Sec-
retary (or the Acting Secretary in the case of the Secretary’s absence or disability) shall person-
ally certify that the requirements for conducting such an investigation have been met and shall
approve commencement of the investigation. The Secretary may withhold the identity of the
Continued
pensation, such as stock options (whether or not based on perform-
ance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria,
as the employer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage level
specified under the application and required under paragraph (1),
the Secretary shall order the employer to provide for payment of
such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with the
requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under sub-
paragraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) If an H–1B-dependent employer places a nonexempt H–1B
nonimmigrant with another employer as provided under paragraph
(1)(F) and the other employer has displaced or displaces a United
States worker employed by such other employer during the period
described in such paragraph, such displacement shall be considered
for purposes of this paragraph a failure, by the placing employer,
to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under
paragraph (1); except that the Attorney General may impose a
sanction described in subclause (II) of subparagraph (C)(i), (C)(ii),
or (C)(iii) only if the Secretary of Labor found that such placing em-
ployer— (i) knew or had reason to know of such displacement at the
time of the placement of the nonimmigrant with the other em-
ployer; or
(ii) has been subject to a sanction under this subparagraph
based upon a previous placement of an H–1B nonimmigrant
with the same other employer.
(F) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an em-
ployer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years, begin-
ning on the date (on or after the date of the enactment of the
American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of
1998) on which the employer is found by the Secretary to have
committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) (or
has been found under paragraph (5) to have committed a willful
failure to meet the condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II)) or to have
made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application.
The preceding sentence shall apply to an employer regardless of
whether or not the employer is an H–1B-dependent employer. The
authority of the Secretary under this subparagraph shall not be
construed to be subject to, or limited by, the requirements of sub-
paragraph (A).

tion 552 of title 5, United States Code.

retary information described in clause (i) that may be used, in whole or in part, as the basis
for commencement of an investigation described in such clause, to provide the information in
writing on a form developed and provided by the Secretary and completed by or on behalf of
the person. The person may not be an officer or employee of the Department of Labor, unless
the information satisfies the requirement of clause (iii)(II) (although an officer or employee of
the Department of Labor may complete the form on behalf of the person).
(iii) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary under clause (i) shall be based
on information that satisfies the requirements of such clause and that (I) originates from a
source other than an officer or employee of the Department of Labor, or (II) was lawfully ob-
tained by the Secretary of Labor in the course of lawfully conducting another Department of
Labor investigation under this Act or any other Act.
(iv) The receipt by the Secretary of information submitted by an employer to the Attorney
General or the Secretary for purposes of securing the employment of an H–1B nonimmigrant
shall not be considered a receipt of information for purposes of clause (i).
(v) No investigation described in clause (i) (or hearing described in clause (vii)) may be con-
ducted with respect to information about a failure to meet a condition described in clause (i),
unless the Secretary receives the information not later than 12 months after the date of the
alleged failure.
(vi) The Secretary shall provide notice to an employer with respect to whom the Secretary
has received information described in clause (i), prior to the commencement of an investigation
under such clause, of the receipt of the information and of the potential for an investigation.
The notice shall be provided in such a manner, and shall contain sufficient detail, to permit
the employer to respond to the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Secretary
is not required to comply with this clause if the Secretary determines that to do so would inter-
fere with an effort by the Secretary to secure compliance by the employer with the requirements
of this subsection. There shall be no judicial review of a determination by the Secretary under
this clause.
(vii) If the Secretary determines under this subparagraph that a reasonable basis exists to
make a finding that a failure described in clause (i) has occurred, the Secretary shall provide
for notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing, in
accordance with section 556 of title 5, United States Code, within 60 days after the date of the
determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary shall make a finding concerning
the matter by not later than 60 days after the date of the hearing.
Section 413(e)(2) of such Public Law (as amended) provides that the amendment made by
paragraph (1) shall cease to be effective on September 30, 2003.

believe that the employer is not in compliance with this subsection.
In the case of an investigation under this clause, the Secretary of
Labor (or the acting Secretary in the case of the absence of dis-
ability of the Secretary of Labor) shall personally certify that rea-
sonable cause exists and shall approve commencement of the inves-
tigation. The investigation may be initiated for reasons other than
completeness and obvious inaccuracies by the employer in com-
plying with this subsection.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible informa-
tion from a source who is likely to have knowledge of an employer’s
practices or employment conditions, or an employer’s compliance
with the employer’s labor condition application under paragraph
(1), and whose identity is known to the Secretary of Labor, and
such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the em-
ployer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of para-

(iii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a procedure for any
person desiring to provide to the Secretary of Labor information de-
scribed in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in part, as the
basis for the commencement of an investigation described in such
clause, to provide the information in writing on a form developed
and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by or on be-
half of the person. The person may not be an officer or employee
of the Department of Labor, unless the information satisfies the re-
quirement of clause (iv)(II) (although an officer or employee of the
Department of Labor may complete the form on behalf of the per-
son).(iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of
Labor under clause (ii) shall be based on information that satisfies
the requirements of such clause and that—
(I) originates from a source other than an officer or em-
ployee of the Department of Labor; or
(II) was lawfully obtained by the Secretary of Labor in the
course of lawfully conducting another Department of Labor in-
vestigation under this Act of any other Act.
(v) The receipt by the Secretary of Labor of information sub-
mitted by an employer to the Attorney General or the Secretary of
Labor for purposes of securing the employment of a nonimmigrant
described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) shall not be considered a re-
ceipt of information for purposes of clause (ii).
(vi) No investigation described in clause (ii) (or hearing de-
scribed in clause (viii) based on such investigation) may be con-
ducted with respect to information about a failure to meet a condi-
tion described in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor receives
the information not later than 12 months after the date of the al-
leged failure.
(vii) The Secretary of Labor shall provide notice to an employer
with respect to whom there is reasonable cause to initiate an inves-
tigation described in clauses (i) or (ii), prior to the commencement
of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent to conduct an
investigation. The notice shall be provided in such a manner, and
shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer to respond to
the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Sec-
retary of Labor is not required to comply with this clause if the
Secretary of Labor determines that to do so would interfere with
an effort by the Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by the em-
ployer with the requirements of this subsection. There shall be no
judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of Labor under
this clause.
(viii) An investigation under clauses (i) or (ii) may be con-
ducted for a period of up to 60 days. If the Secretary of Labor de-
termines after such an investigation that a reasonable basis exists
to make a finding that the employer has committed a willful failure
to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F),
or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to
meet such a condition, or has committed a substantial failure to
meet such a condition that affects multiple employees, the Sec-
retary of Labor shall provide for notice of such determination to the
interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance
with section 556 of title 5, United States Code, within 120 days

the Secretary of Labor shall make a finding concerning the matter
by not later than 120 days after the date of the hearing.
(H)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a person or
entity is considered to have complied with the requirements of this
subsection, notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure to
meet such requirements, if there was a good faith attempt to com-
ply with the requirements.

less than 10 business days (beginning after the date of the ex-
planation) within which to correct the failure; and

untarily within such period.
(iii) A person or entity that, in the course of an investiga-
tion, is found to have violated the prevailing wage require-

or other penalties for such violation if the person or entity can
establish that the manner in which the prevailing wage was
calculated was consistent with recognized industry standards
and practices.
(iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or enti-
ty that has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice
of willful violations of this subsection.

other Act.
(3)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘H–1B-depend-
ent employer’’ means an employer that—
(i)(I) has 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees who
are employed in the United States; and (II) employs more than
7 H–1B nonimmigrants;

(i) in computing the number of full-time equivalent em-
ployees and the number of H–1B nonimmigrants, exempt H–
1B nonimmigrants shall not be taken into account during the
longer of—
(I) the 6-month period beginning on the date of the en-
actment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce
Improvement Act of 1998; or
(II) the period beginning on the date of the enactment
of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improve-
ment Act of 1998 and ending on the date final regulations
are issued to carry out this paragraph; and
(ii) any group treated as a single employer under sub-
section (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 shall be treated as a single employer.
(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘area of employment’’ means the area within
normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location
where the work of the H–1B nonimmigrant is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an application with respect to one or
more H–1B nonimmigrants by an employer, the employer is
considered to ‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if
the employer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially
the equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or non-
immigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to
be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves es-
sentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United States
worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experi-
ence, and is located in the same area of employment as the
other job.
(C) The term ‘‘H–1B nonimmigrant’’ means an alien admit-
ted or provided status as a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b).
(D)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract (other than a temporary employment contract en-
tered into in order to evade a condition described in sub-
paragraph (E) or (F) of paragraph (1)); but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
(or, in the case of a placement of a worker with another
employer under paragraph (1)(F), with either employer de-
scribed in such paragraph) at equivalent or higher com-
pensation and benefits than the position from which the
employee was discharged, regardless of whether or not the
employee accepts the offer.

to be employed.
(5)(A) This paragraph shall apply instead of subparagraphs (A)
through (E) of paragraph (2) in the case of a violation described in
subparagraph (B), but shall not be construed to limit or affect the
authority of the Secretary or the Attorney General with respect to
any other violation.
(B) The Attorney General shall establish a process for the re-
ceipt, initial review, and disposition in accordance with this para-
graph of complaints respecting an employer’s failure to meet the
condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or a petitioner’s misrepresenta-
tion of material facts with respect to such condition. Complaints
may be filed by an aggrieved individual who has submitted a
re´sume´ or otherwise applied in a reasonable manner for the job
that is the subject of the condition. No proceeding shall be con-
ducted under this paragraph on a complaint concerning such a fail-
ure or misrepresentation unless the Attorney General determines
that the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the
date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.
(C) If the Attorney General finds that a complaint has been
filed in accordance with subparagraph (B) and there is reasonable
cause to believe that such a failure or misrepresentation described
in such complaint has occurred, the Attorney General shall initiate
binding arbitration proceedings by requesting the Federal Medi-
ation and Conciliation Service to appoint an arbitrator from the
roster of arbitrators maintained by such Service. The procedure
and rules of such Service shall be applicable to the selection of such
arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Attorney Gen-
eral shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.
(D)(i) The arbitrator shall make findings respecting whether a
failure or misrepresentation described in subparagraph (B) oc-
curred. If the arbitrator concludes that failure or misrepresentation
was willful, the arbitrator shall make a finding to that effect. The
arbitrator may not find such a failure or misrepresentation (or that
such a failure or misrepresentation was willful) unless the com-
plainant demonstrates such a failure or misrepresentation (or its
willful character) by clear and convincing evidence. The arbitrator
shall transmit the findings in the form of a written opinion to the
parties to the arbitration and the Attorney General. Such findings
shall be final and conclusive, and, except as provided in this sub-
paragraph, no official or court of the United States shall have
power or jurisdiction to review any such findings.

such institutions and organizations in the area of employment.
(2) With respect to a professional athlete (as defined in sub-

fessional sports league rules or regulations, the wage set forth in
those rules or regulations shall be considered as not adversely af-

(4) Where the Secretary of Labor uses, or makes available to
employers, a governmental survey to determine the prevailing
wage, such survey shall provide at least 4 levels of wages commen-
surate with experience, education, and the level of supervision.
Where an existing government survey has only 2 levels, 2 inter-
mediate levels may be created by dividing by 3, the difference be-
tween the 2 levels offered, adding the quotient thus obtained to the
first level and subtracting that quotient from the second level.

years, beginning on the date on which the employer is found by the
Secretary of Labor to have committed a willful failure to meet a
condition of paragraph (1) or to have made a willful misrepresenta-

ered to ‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the em-
ployer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the
equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or non-
immigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to
be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves es-

section, the term ‘‘Federal poverty line’’ means the level of income
equal to the official poverty line (as defined by the Director of the

ADMISSION OF NONIMMIGRANTS
SEC. 214. ø8 U.S.C. 1184¿ (a)(1) The admission to the United
States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and
under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations
prescribe, including when he deems necessary the giving of a bond
with sufficient surety in such sum and containing such conditions
as the Attorney General shall prescribe, to insure that at the expi-
ration of such time or upon failure to maintain the status under
which he was admitted, or to maintain any status subsequently ac-
quired under section 248, such alien will depart from the United
States. No alien admitted to Guam or the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands without a visa pursuant to section 212(l)
may be authorized to enter or stay in the United States other than
in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
or to remain in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mar-
iana Islands for a period exceeding 45 days from date of admission
to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
No alien admitted to the United States without a visa pursuant to
section 217 may be authorized to remain in the United States as
a nonimmigrant visitor for a period exceeding 90 days from the
date of admission.
(2) 197 (A) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant
described in section 101(a)(15)(O) shall be for such period as the
Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the event (or
events) for which the nonimmigrant is admitted.
(B) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant de-
scribed in section 101(a)(15)(P) shall be for such period as the At-
torney General may specify in order to provide for the competition,
event, or performance for which the nonimmigrant is admitted. In
the case of nonimmigrants admitted as individual athletes under
section 101(a)(15)(P), the period of authorized status may be for an
initial period (not to exceed 5 years) during which the non-
immigrant will perform as an athlete and such period may be ex-
tended by the Attorney General for an additional period of up to
5 years.
(b) Every alien (other than a nonimmigrant described in sub-
paragraph (L) or (V) of section 101(a)(15), and other than a non-
immigrant described in any provision of section 101(a)(15)(H)(i) ex-
cept subclause (b1) of such section) shall be presumed to be an im-
migrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular offi-
cer, at the time of application for a visa, and the immigration offi-
cers, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to
a nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15). An alien who is an

employee, or member of the immediate family of any such alien
shall not be entitled to apply for or receive an immigrant visa, or
to enter the United States as an immigrant unless he executes a
written waiver in the same form and substance as is prescribed by
section 247(b).
(c)(1) 198 The question of importing any alien as a non-
immigrant under subparagraph (H), (L), (O), or (P)(i) of section
101(a)(15) (excluding nonimmigrants under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)) in any specific case or specific cases shall be
determined by the Attorney General, after consultation with appro-
priate agencies of the Government, upon petition of the importing
employer. Such petition shall be made and approved before the visa
is granted. The petition shall be in such form and contain such in-
formation as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The approval of
such a petition shall not, of itself, be construed as establishing that
the alien is a nonimmigrant. For purposes of this subsection with
respect to nonimmigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a),
the term ‘‘appropriate agencies of Government’’ means the Depart-
ment of Labor and includes the Department of Agriculture. The
provisions of section 218 shall apply to the question of importing
any alien as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a).
(2) 199 (A) The Attorney General shall provide for a procedure
under which an importing employer which meets requirements es-
tablished by the Attorney General may file a blanket petition to
import aliens as nonimmigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(L)
instead of filing individual petitions under paragraph (1) to import
such aliens. Such procedure shall permit the expedited processing
of visas for admission 200 of aliens covered under such a petition.
(B) For purposes of section 101(a)(15)(L), an alien is considered
to be serving in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with re-
spect to a company if the alien has a special knowledge of the com-
pany product and its application in international markets or has an
advanced level of knowledge of processes and procedures of the
company. 201

alien admitted under such section, the Attorney General shall au-
thorize the alien spouse to engage in employment in the United
States and provide the spouse with an ‘‘employment authorized’’
endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
(F) An alien who will serve in a capacity involving specialized
knowledge with respect to an employer for purposes of section
101(a)(15)(L) and will be stationed primarily at the worksite of an
employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate, sub-
sidiary, or parent shall not be eligible for classification under sec-
tion 101(a)(15)(L) if—
(i) the alien will be controlled and supervised principally
by such unaffiliated employer; or
(ii) the placement of the alien at the worksite of the unaf-
filiated employer is essentially an arrangement to provide
labor for hire for the unaffiliated employer, rather than a
placement in connection with the provision of a product or
service for which specialized knowledge specific to the peti-

motion picture or television production, after consultation with
such a labor organization and a management organization in
the area of the alien’s ability.
In the case of an alien seeking entry for a motion picture or tele-
vision production, (i) any opinion under the previous sentence shall
only be advisory, (ii) any such opinion that recommends denial
must be in writing, (iii) in making the decision the Attorney Gen-

opinion. The Attorney General shall provide by regulation for the
waiver of the consultation requirement under subparagraph (A) in
the case of aliens who have been admitted as nonimmigrants under
section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) because of extraordinary ability in the arts
and who seek readmission to perform similar services within 2
years after the date of a consultation under such subparagraph.

just upwards the numerical limitation in paragraph (1)(A) for that
fiscal year by the amount remaining in the numerical limitation

employer has filed with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under

obtain such extension.

the grant of such waiver would not cause the number of waiv-
ers allotted for that State for that fiscal year to exceed 30;
(C) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agen-
cy or by an interested State agency—
(i) the alien demonstrates a bona fide offer of full-time

tion, which employment has been determined by the Attor-
ney General to be in the public interest; and
(ii) the alien agrees to begin employment with the
health facility or health care organization within 90 days
of receiving such waiver, and agrees to continue to work
for a total of not less than 3 years (unless the Attorney
General determines that extenuating circumstances exist,
such as closure of the facility or hardship to the alien,
which would justify a lesser period of employment at such
health facility or health care organization, in which case
the alien must demonstrate another bona fide offer of em-
ployment at a health facility or health care organization
for the remainder of such 3-year period); and
(D) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agen-
cy (other than a request by an interested Federal agency to
employ the alien full-time in medical research or training) or
by an interested State agency, the alien agrees to practice pri-
mary care or specialty medicine in accordance with paragraph

fessionals, except that—
(i) in the case of a request by the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, the alien shall not be required to practice
medicine in a geographic area designated by the Secretary;
(ii) in the case of a request by an interested State
agency, the head of such State agency determines that the
alien is to practice medicine under such agreement in a fa-
cility that serves patients who reside in one or more geo-
graphic areas so designated by the Secretary of Health and
Human Services (without regard to whether such facility
is located within such a designated geographic area), and
the grant of such waiver would not cause the number of
the waivers granted on behalf of aliens for such State for
a fiscal year (within the limitation in subparagraph (B)) in
accordance with the conditions of this clause to exceed 10;
and
(iii) in the case of a request by an interested Federal
agency or by an interested State agency for a waiver for
an alien who agrees to practice specialty medicine in a fa-
cility located in a geographic area so designated by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, the request shall
demonstrate, based on criteria established by such agency,
that there is a shortage of health care professionals able
to provide services in the appropriate medical specialty to
the patients who will be served by the alien.

in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The numerical limitations con-
tained in subsection (g)(1)(A) shall not apply to any alien
whose status is changed under the preceding sentence, if the
alien obtained a waiver of the 2-year foreign residence require-
ment upon a request by an interested Federal agency or an in-
terested State agency.
(B) No person who has obtained a change of status under

named in the waiver application shall be eligible to apply for
an immigrant visa, for permanent residence, or for any other
change of nonimmigrant status, until it is established that
such person has resided and been physically present in the
country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate

the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e)
shall apply with respect to an alien described in clause (iii) of
such section, who has not otherwise been accorded status
under section 101(a)(27)(H), if—

agreement entered into under subparagraph (C) or (D) of
paragraph (1); or
(B) the alien’s employment ceases to benefit the public
interest at any time during the 3-year period described in
paragraph (1)(C).

under clause (i) or (iii) of section 101(a)(15)(F) in order to pursue
a course of study—

adult education program; or
(B) at a public secondary school unless—
(i) the aggregate period of such status at such a school
does not exceed 12 months with respect to any alien, and
(ii) the alien demonstrates that the alien has reimbursed
the local educational agency that administers the school
for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of providing edu-
cation at such school for the period of the alien’s attend-
ance.
(2) An alien who obtains the status of a nonimmigrant under
clause (i) or (iii) of section 101(a)(15)(F) in order to pursue a course
of study at a private elementary or secondary school or in a lan-
guage training program that is not publicly funded shall be consid-
ered to have violated such status, and the alien’s visa under section
101(a)(15)(F) shall be void, if the alien terminates or abandons
such course of study at such a school and undertakes a course of
study at a public elementary school, in a publicly funded adult edu-
cation program, in a publicly funded adult education language
training program, or at a public secondary school (unless the re-
quirements of paragraph (1)(B) are met).

under section 245(m) and is unable to obtain such relief be-
cause regulations have not been issued to implement such sec-

(ii) DATA PROVISION BY CARRIERS.—Not later than
October 1, 2002, no waiver may be provided under this
section to an alien arriving by sea or air at a port of
entry into the United States on a carrier unless the

with the annual report required to be submitted on
that date under section 110(e)(1) of the Illegal Immi-
gration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of
1996.
(2) AUTOMATED DATA SHARING SYSTEM.—
(A) SYSTEM.—The Secretary of Homeland Security and

State or the Service; and
(II) information on whether the alien has ever
been determined to be ineligible to receive a visa
or ineligible to be admitted to the United States.

gram country and has been determined to be ineligible
to receive a visa.

to determine, in advance of travel, the eligibility of, and
whether there exists a law enforcement or security risk in
permitting, the alien to travel to the United States.
(B) FEES.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—No later than 6 months after the
date of enactment of the Travel Promotion Act of 2009,

administer the System.
(iii) SUNSET OF TRAVEL PROMOTION FUND FEE.—
The Secretary may not collect the fee authorized by
clause (i)(I) for fiscal years beginning after October 31,
2028.
(C) VALIDITY.—
(i) PERIOD.—The Secretary of Homeland Security,
in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall pre-
scribe regulations that provide for a period, not to ex-
ceed three years, during which a determination of eli-
gibility to travel under the program will be valid. Not-
withstanding any other provision under this section,
the Secretary of Homeland Security may revoke any
such determination or shorten the period of eligibility
under any such determination at any time and for any
reason.
(ii) LIMITATION.—A determination by the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security that an alien is eligible
to travel to the United States under the program is
not a determination that the alien is admissible to the
United States.
(iii) NOT A DETERMINATION OF VISA ELIGIBILITY.—
A determination by the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity that an alien who applied for authorization to
travel to the United States through the System is not
eligible to travel under the program is not a deter-
mination of eligibility for a visa to travel to the United
States and shall not preclude the alien from applying
for a visa.

provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to re-
view an eligibility determination under the System.

from an applicant for admission pursuant to this section
information on any additional or previous countries of citi-
zenship of that applicant. The Secretary shall take any in-
formation so collected into account when making deter-
minations as to the eligibility of the alien for admission
pursuant to this section.

H–2A PETITIONS.—(1) A petition to import an alien as an H–2A
worker (as defined in subsection (i)(2)) may not be approved by the
Attorney General unless the petitioner has applied to the Secretary
of Labor for a certification that—
(A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing,
and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place

(1) There is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dis-
pute which, under the regulations, precludes such certification.
(2)(A) The employer during the previous two-year period
employed H–2A workers and the Secretary of Labor has deter-
mined, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the em-
ployer at any time during that period substantially violated a
material term or condition of the labor certification with re-
spect to the employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers.
(B) No employer may be denied certification under sub-
paragraph (A) for more than three years for any violation de-
scribed in such subparagraph.
(3) The employer has not provided the Secretary with sat-

tification is sought is not covered by State workers’ compensa-
tion law, the employer will provide, at no cost to the worker,
insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the
course of the worker’s employment which will provide benefits
at least equal to those provided under the State workers’ com-
pensation law for comparable employment.
(4) The Secretary determines that the employer has not
made positive recruitment efforts within a multi-state region of
traditional or expected labor supply where the Secretary finds
that there are a significant number of qualified United States
workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves
available for work at the time and place needed. Positive re-
cruitment under this paragraph is in addition to, and shall be
conducted within the same time period as, the circulation

ment under this paragraph shall terminate on the date the H–
2A workers depart for the employer’s place of employment.

tification (including criteria for the recruitment of eligible
individuals as prescribed by the Secretary), and

an employee performs any agricultural labor for not less than one hour.’’
241 See Appendix II.B.1. for provision.
(ii) the employer does not actually have, or has not
been provided with referrals of, qualified eligible individ-
uals who have indicated their availability to perform such
labor or services on the terms and conditions of a job offer
which meets the requirements of the Secretary.
In considering the question of whether a specific qualification
is appropriate in a job offer, the Secretary shall apply the nor-
mal and accepted qualifications required by non-H–2A-employ-
ers in the same or comparable occupations and crops.
(B)(i) For a period of 3 years subsequent to the effective
date of this section, labor certifications shall remain effective
only if, from the time the foreign worker departs for the em-
ployer’s place of employment, the employer will provide em-
ployment to any qualified United States worker who applies to
the employer until 50 percent of the period of the work con-
tract, under which the foreign worker who is in the job was
hired, has elapsed. In addition, the employer will offer to pro-
vide benefits, wages and working conditions required pursuant
to this section and regulations.
(ii) The requirement of clause (i) shall not apply to any em-
ployer who—
(I) did not, during any calendar quarter during the
preceding calendar year, use more than 500 man-days of
agricultural labor, as defined in section 3(u) of the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(u)), 240

advisability of continuing a policy which requires an employer,
as a condition for certification under this section, to continue
to accept qualified, eligible United States workers for employ-
ment after the date the H–2A workers depart for work with
the employer. The Secretary’s review of such findings and ma-
terials shall lead to the issuance of findings in furtherance of
the Congressional policy that aliens not be admitted under this
section unless there are not sufficient workers in the United
States who are able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor
or service needed and that the employment of the aliens in
such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and

date of need.
(4) HOUSING.—Employers shall furnish housing in accord-
ance with regulations. The employer shall be permitted at the
employer’s option to provide housing meeting applicable Fed-
eral standards for temporary labor camps or to secure housing
which meets the local standards for rental and/or public accom-

nished by an employer for an H–2A worker meets the require-
ments imposed by this paragraph must be made prior to the
date specified in paragraph (3)(A) by which the Secretary of
Labor is required to make a certification described in sub-
section (a)(1) with respect to a petition for the importation of
such worker.
(d) ROLES OF AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS.—
(1) PERMITTING FILING BY AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS.—A
petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural worker,
and an application for a labor certification with respect to such
a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural pro-
ducers which use agricultural services.
(2) TREATMENT OF ASSOCIATIONS ACTING AS EMPLOYERS.—
If an association is a joint or sole employer of temporary agri-
cultural workers, the certifications granted under this section
to the association may be used for the certified job opportuni-
ties of any of its producer members and such workers may be
transferred among its producer members to perform agricul-
tural services of a temporary or seasonal nature for which the
certifications were granted.
(3) TREATMENT OF VIOLATIONS.—
(A) MEMBER’S VIOLATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY DIS-
QUALIFY ASSOCIATION OR OTHER MEMBERS.—If an indi-
vidual producer member of a joint employer association is
determined to have committed an act that under sub-
section (b)(2) results in the denial of certification with re-
spect to the member, the denial shall apply only to that
member of the association unless the Secretary determines
that the association or other member participated in, had
knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.
(B) ASSOCIATION’S VIOLATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY
DISQUALIFY MEMBERS.—(i) If an association representing
agricultural producers as a joint employer is determined to
have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) results
in the denial of certification with respect to the associa-
tion, the denial shall apply only to the association and
does not apply to any individual producer member of the
association unless the Secretary determines that the mem-
ber participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know
of, the violation.
(ii) If an association of agricultural producers certified
as a sole employer is determined to have committed an act

directly or through an association which is a joint em-
ployer of such workers with the producer member.
(e) EXPEDITED ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS OF CERTAIN DETER-
MINATIONS.—(1) Regulations shall provide for an expedited proce-
dure for the review of a denial of certification under subsection
(a)(1) or a revocation of such a certification or, at the applicant’s
request, for a de novo administrative hearing respecting the denial
or revocation.
(2) The Secretary of Labor shall expeditiously, but in no case
later than 72 hours after the time a new determination is re-
quested, make a new determination on the request for certification
in the case of an H–2A worker if able, willing, and qualified eligible
individuals are not actually available at the time such labor or
services are required and a certification was denied in whole or in
part because of the availability of qualified workers. If the em-
ployer asserts that any eligible individual who has been referred is
not able, willing, or qualified, the burden of proof is on the em-
ployer to establish that the individual referred is not able, willing,
or qualified because of employment-related reasons.
(f) VIOLATORS DISQUALIFIED FOR 5 YEARS.—An alien may not
be admitted to the United States as a temporary agricultural work-
er if the alien was admitted to the United States as such a worker

riod violated a term or condition of such previous admission.

services which might otherwise be performed by non-
immigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), and
(B) of monitoring terms and conditions under which such
nonimmigrants (and domestic workers employed by the same
employers) are employed in the United States.
(2) The Secretary of Labor is authorized to take such actions,
including imposing appropriate penalties and seeking appropriate
injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations,
as may be necessary to assure employer compliance with terms and
conditions of employment under this section.
(3) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year,
beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for
the purpose of enabling the Secretary of Labor to make determina-
tions and certifications under this section and under section
212(a)(5)(A)(i).
(4) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year,
beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for
the purposes of enabling the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out
the Secretary’s duties and responsibilities under this section.
(h) MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.—(1) The Attorney General
shall provide for such endorsement of entry and exit documents of
nonimmigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii) as may be nec-
essary to carry out this section and to provide notice for purposes
of section 274A.

CHAPTER 3—ISSUANCE OF ENTRY DOCUMENTS
ISSUANCE OF VISAS
S EC. 221. ø8 U.S.C. 1201¿ (a)(1) Under the conditions herein-
after prescribed and subject to the limitations prescribed in this
Act or regulations issued thereunder, a consular officer may issue
(A) to an immigrant who has made proper application therefor, an
immigrant visa which shall consist of the application provided for
in section 222, visaed by such consular officer, and shall specify the
foreign state, if any, to which the immigrant is charged, the immi-
grant’s particular status under such foreign state, the preference,
immediate relative, or special immigrant classification to which the
alien is charged, the date on which the validity of the visa shall
expire, and such additional information as may be required; and
(B) to a nonimmigrant who has made proper application therefor,
a nonimmigrant visa, which shall specify the classification under
section 101(a)(15) of the nonimmigrant, the period during which
the nonimmigrant visa shall be valid, and such additional informa-
tion as may be required.
(2) The Secretary of State shall provide to the Service an elec-

(b) Each alien who applies for a visa shall be registered in con-
nection with his application, and shall furnish copies of his photo-
graph signed by him for such use as may be by regulations re-
quired. The requirements of this subsection may be waived in the

waived for certain residents of Hong Kong under § 154 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (P.L. 101–
649, Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 5006), shown in Appendix II.A.1.
(c) 242 PERIOD OF VALIDITY; RENEWAL OR REPLACEMENT.—
(1) IMMIGRANT VISAS.—An immigrant visa shall be valid
for such period, not exceeding six months, as shall be by regu-
lations prescribed, except that any visa issued to a child law-
fully adopted by a United States citizen and spouse while such
citizen is serving abroad in the United States Armed Forces,
or is employed abroad by the United States Government, or is
temporarily abroad on business, shall be valid until such time,
for a period not to exceed three years, as the adoptive citizen
parent returns to the United States in due course of his serv-
ice, employment, or business.
(2) NONIMMIGRANT VISAS.—A nonimmigrant visa shall be
valid for such periods as shall be by regulations prescribed. In
prescribing the period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa in the
case of nationals of any foreign country who are eligible for
such visas, the Secretary of State shall, insofar as practicable,
accord to such nationals the same treatment upon a reciprocal
basis as such foreign country accords to nationals of the United
States who are within a similar class; except that in the case
of aliens who are nationals of a foreign country and who either
are granted refugee status and firmly resettled in another for-
eign country or are granted permanent residence and residing
in another foreign country, the Secretary of State may pre-
scribe the period of validity of such a visa based upon the
treatment granted by that other foreign country to alien refu-
gees and permanent residents, respectively, in the United
States.
(3) VISA REPLACEMENT.—An immigrant visa may be re-
placed under the original number during the fiscal year in
which the original visa was issued for an immigrant who es-
tablishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer that the im-
migrant—
(A) was unable to use the original immigrant visa dur-
ing the period of its validity because of reasons beyond his
control and for which he was not responsible;
(B) is found by a consular officer to be eligible for an
immigrant visa; and
(C) pays again the statutory fees for an application
and an immigrant visa.
(4) FEE WAIVER.—If an immigrant visa was issued, on or
after March 27, 2013, for a child who has been lawfully adopt-
ed, or who is coming to the United States to be adopted, by a
United States citizen, any statutory immigrant visa fees relat-
ing to a renewal or replacement of such visa may be waived
or, if already paid, may be refunded upon request, subject to
such criteria as the Secretary of State may prescribe, if—
(A) the immigrant child was unable to use the original
immigrant visa during the period of its validity as a direct
result of extraordinary circumstances, including the denial
of an exit permit; and

(d) Prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa to any alien, the
consular officer shall require such alien to submit to a physical and
mental examination in accordance with such regulations as may be
prescribed. Prior to the issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to any
alien, the consular officer may require such alien to submit to a
physical or mental examination, or both, if in his opinion such ex-
amination is necessary to ascertain whether such alien is eligible
to receive a visa.
(e) Each immigrant shall surrender his immigrant visa to the
immigration officer at the port of entry, who shall endorse on the
visa the date and the port of arrival, the identity of the vessel or
other means of transportation by which the immigrant arrived, and
such other endorsements as may be by regulations required.
(f) Each nonimmigrant shall present or surrender to the immi-
gration officer at the port of entry such documents as may be by
regulation required. In the case of an alien crewman not in posses-
sion of any individual documents other than a passport and until
such time as it becomes practicable to issue individual documents,
such alien crewman may be admitted, subject to the provisions of
this title, if his name appears in the crew list of the vessel or air-
craft on which he arrives and the crew list is visaed by a consular
officer, but the consular officer shall have the right to deny admis-
sion to 243 any alien crewman from the crew list visa.
(g) No visa or other documentation shall be issued to an alien
if (1) it appears to the consular officer, from statements in the ap-
plication, or in the papers submitted therewith, that such alien is
ineligible to receive a visa or such other documentation under sec-
tion 212, or any other provision of law, (2) the application fails to
comply with the provisions of this Act, or the regulations issued

or any other provision of law. The substance of this subsection
shall appear upon every visa application.

alien, the consular officer or the Secretary of State may at any
time, in his discretion, revoke such visa or other documentation.
Notice of such revocation shall be communicated to the Attorney
General, and such revocation shall invalidate the visa or other doc-
umentation from the date of issuance: Provided, That carriers or
transportation companies, and masters, commanding officers,
agents, owners, charterers, or consignees, shall not be penalized
under section 273(b) for action taken in reliance on such visas or
other documentation, unless they received due notice of such rev-
ocation prior to the alien’s embarkation. There shall be no means
of judicial review (including review pursuant to section 2241 of title
28, United States Code, or any other habeas corpus provision, and
sections 1361 and 1651 of such title) of a revocation under this sub-

248 The Department of State has cited this provision as the basis for the exemption of visa
records from disclosure under section 552(b)(3) of title 5, United States Code (commonly known
as the Freedom of Information Act). Section 405(b)(2) of the State Department Basic Authorities
Act of 1956 (as added by § 198(a) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
and 1993 (Pub.L. 102–138, Oct. 28, 1991)) provides as follows:
(2) Records described in section 222(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating
to visa records) shall be excluded from publication in the FRUS series under section 403
and, to the extent applicable, exempted from the declassification requirement of section 404.
cerning him or his case which may be required by the consular offi-
cer. The copy of each document so furnished shall be permanently
attached to the application and become a part thereof. In the event
that the immigrant establishes to the satisfaction of the consular
officer that any document or record required by this subsection is
unobtainable, the consular officer may permit the immigrant to
submit in lieu of such document or record other satisfactory evi-
dence of the fact to which such document or record would, if obtain-
able, pertain. All immigrant visa applications shall be reviewed
and adjudicated by a consular officer.
(c) Every alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa and for alien
registration shall make application therefor in such form and man-
ner as shall be by regulations prescribed. In the application the
alien shall state his full and true name, the date and place of birth,
his nationality, the purpose and length of his intended stay in the
United States; his marital status; and such additional information
necessary to the identification of the applicant, the determination
of his eligibility for a nonimmigrant visa, and the enforcement of
the immigration and nationality laws as may be by regulations pre-
scribed. The alien shall provide complete and accurate information
in response to any request for information contained in the applica-
tion. At the discretion of the Secretary of State, application forms
for the various classes of nonimmigrant admissions described in
section 101(a)(15) may vary according to the class of visa being re-
quested.
(d) Every alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa and alien
registration shall furnish to the consular officer, with his applica-
tion, a certified copy of such documents pertaining to him as may
be by regulations required. All nonimmigrant visa applications
shall be reviewed and adjudicated by a consular officer.
(e) Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations, each
application for an immigrant visa shall be signed by the applicant
in the presence of the consular officer, and verified by the oath of
the applicant administered by the consular officer. The application
for an immigrant visa, when visaed by the consular officer, shall
become the immigrant visa. The application for a nonimmigrant
visa or other documentation as a nonimmigrant shall be disposed
of as may be by regulations prescribed. The issuance of a non-
immigrant visa shall, except as may be otherwise by regulations
prescribed, be evidenced by a stamp, or other placed in the alien’s
passport.
(f) 248 The records of the Department of State and of diplomatic
and consular offices of the United States pertaining to the issuance
or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States shall be
considered confidential and shall be used only for the formulation,
amendment, administration, or enforcement of the immigration,
nationality, and other laws of the United States, except that—

(2) the Secretary of State, in the Secretary’s discretion and
on the basis of reciprocity, may provide to a foreign govern-
ment information in the Department of State’s computerized

other records covered by this section related to information in
the database—
(A) with regard to individual aliens, at any time on a
case-by-case basis for the purpose of preventing, inves-
tigating, or punishing acts that would constitute a crime
in the United States, including, but not limited to, ter-
rorism or trafficking in controlled substances, persons, or
illicit weapons; or
(B) with regard to any or all aliens in the database,
pursuant to such conditions as the Secretary of State shall
establish in an agreement with the foreign government in
which that government agrees to use such information and
records for the purposes described in subparagraph (A) or
to deny visas to persons who would be inadmissible to the
United States.
(g)(1) In the case of an alien who has been admitted on the
basis of a nonimmigrant visa and remained in the United States
beyond the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General, such
visa shall be void beginning after the conclusion of such period of
stay.

readmitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, except—
(A) on the basis of a visa (other than the visa described in
paragraph (1)) issued in a consular office located in the country
of the alien’s nationality (or, if there is no office in such coun-
try, in such other consular office as the Secretary of State shall
specify); or
(B) where extraordinary circumstances are found by the
Secretary of State to exist.
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall require every alien applying for a non-
immigrant visa—

for permanent residence, or (2) any alien lawfully admitted to the
United States pursuant to clause 6 of section 3 of the Immigration
Act of 1924, between July 1, 1924, and July 5, 1932, both dates in-
clusive, who intends to depart temporarily from the United States
may make application to the Attorney General for a permit to reen-
ter the United States, stating the length of his intended absence
or absences, and the reasons therefor. Such application shall be
made under oath, and shall be in such form, contain such informa-
tion, and be accompanied by such photographs of the applicant as
may be by regulations prescribed.
(b) If the Attorney General finds (1) that the applicant under
subsection (a)(1) has been lawfully admitted to the United States
for permanent residence, or that the applicant under subsection
(a)(2) has since admission maintained the status required of him
at the time of his admission and such applicant desires to visit
abroad and to return to the United States to resume the status ex-
isting at the time of his departure for such visit, (2) that the appli-
cation is made in good faith, and (3) that the alien’s proposed de-
parture from the United States would not be contrary to the inter-
ests of the United States, the Attorney General may, in his discre-
tion, issue the permit, which shall be valid for not more than two
years from the date of issuance and shall not be renewable. The
permit shall be in such form as shall be by regulations prescribed
for the complete identification of the alien.
(c) During the period of validity, such permit may be used by
the alien in making one or more applications for reentry into the
United States.
(d) Upon the return of the alien to the United States the per-
mit shall be presented to the immigration officer at the port of
entry, and upon the expiration of its validity, the permit shall be
surrendered to the Service.

person to whom issued, shall be accepted in lieu of any visa which
otherwise would be required from such person under this Act. Oth-
erwise a permit issued under this section shall have no effect under
the immigration laws except to show that the alien to whom it was
issued is returning from a temporary visit abroad; but nothing in
this section shall be construed as making such permit the exclusive
means of establishing that the alien is so returning.

served by such medical officers in any such alien. If medical officers
of the United States Public Health Service are not available, civil
surgeons of not less than four years’ professional experience may

ulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, and under medical
regulations prepared by the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-

adjacent islands shall provide and maintain at its expense suitable
landing stations, approved by the Attorney General, conveniently

shall be allowed to land any alien passengers in the United States
until such landing stations are provided, and unless such stations
are thereafter maintained to the satisfaction of the Attorney Gen-
eral.
(c) The Attorney General shall have power to enter into con-
tracts including bonding agreements with transportation lines to

continuous transit of aliens destined to foreign countries. Notwith-
standing any other provision of this Act, such aliens may not have
their classification changed under section 248.

DESIGNATION OF PORTS OF ENTRY FOR ALIENS ARRIVING BY CIVIL
AIRCRAFT
SEC. 234. ø8 U.S.C. 1224¿ The Attorney General is authorized
(1) by regulation to designate as ports of entry for aliens arriving
by aircraft any of the ports of entry for civil aircraft designated as
such in accordance with law; (2) by regulation to provide such rea-
sonable requirements for aircraft in civil air navigation with re-
spect to giving notice of intention to land in advance of landing, or
notice of landing, as shall be deemed necessary for purposes of ad-
ministration and enforcement of this Act; and (3) by regulation to
provide for the application to civil air navigation of the provisions
of this Act where not expressly so provided in this Act to such ex-
tent and upon such conditions as he deems necessary. Any person
who violates any regulation made under this section shall be sub-
ject to a civil penalty of $2,000 253 which may be remitted or miti-
gated by the Attorney General in accordance with such proceedings
as the Attorney General shall by regulation prescribe. 254 In case
the violation is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft,
the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft, and such aircraft may
be libeled therefor in the appropriate United States court. The de-
termination by the Attorney General and remission or mitigation
of the civil penalty shall be final. In case the violation is by the
owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be
a lien upon the aircraft and may be collected by proceedings in rem
which shall conform as nearly as may be to civil suits in admiralty.
The Supreme Court of the United States, and under its direction
other courts of the United States, are authorized to prescribe rules
regulating such proceedings against aircraft in any particular not

this section may be summarily seized by, and placed in the custody
of such persons as the Attorney General may by regulation pre-
scribe. The aircraft may be released from such custody upon de-
posit of such amount not exceeding $2,000 253 as the Attorney Gen-
eral may prescribe, or of a bond in such sum and with such sure-
ties as the Attorney General may prescribe, conditioned upon the
payment of the penalty which may be finally determined by the At-
torney General.

or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a des-
ignated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought
to the United States after having been interdicted in inter-
national or United States waters) shall be deemed for purposes
of this Act an applicant for admission.
(2) S TOWAWAYS.—An arriving alien who is a stowaway is
not eligible to apply for admission or to be admitted and shall
be ordered removed upon inspection by an immigration officer.
Upon such inspection if the alien indicates an intention to
apply for asylum under section 208 or a fear of persecution, the
officer shall refer the alien for an interview under subsection
(b)(1)(B). A stowaway may apply for asylum only if the stow-
away is found to have a credible fear of persecution under sub-
section (b)(1)(B). In no case may a stowaway be considered an
applicant for admission or eligible for a hearing under section
240.
(3) INSPECTION.—All aliens (including alien crewmen) who
are applicants for admission or otherwise seeking admission or
readmission to or transit through the United States shall be
inspected by immigration officers.
(4) WITHDRAWAL OF APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION.—An

tional periods of up to six months only if the release of the
alien will threaten the national security of the United States

months. If the Attorney General determines, in the Attorney
General’s discretion, that the certification should be revoked,

272 See the appendix in this compilation for the provisions as in effect before April 1, 1997.
(h) Paragraphs (1), (2), (5), (9), or (12) of subsection 241(a) (other than so much of paragraph
(1) as relates to a ground of exclusion described in paragraph (9), (10), (23), (27), (29), or (33)

status.
(II) the alien was found to have violated a
protection order intended to protect the alien; or
(III) the alien committed, was arrested for,
was convicted of, or pled guilty to committing a
crime— (aa) that did not result in serious bodily

forth a prima facie case for approval, the Secretary may grant the
alien an administrative stay of a final order of removal under sec-
tion 241(c)(2) until—
(A) the application for nonimmigrant status under such
subparagraph (T) or (U) is approved; or

for such nonimmigrant status after the exhaustion of adminis-
trative appeals.

A LIENS.—

for the availability of special removal 273 proceedings at certain
Federal, State, and local correctional facilities for aliens con-
victed of any criminal offense covered in section

tion 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) for which both predicate offenses are, with-
out regard to the date of their commission, otherwise covered
by section 241(a)(2)(A)(i). Such proceedings shall be conducted
in conformity with section 240 (except as otherwise provided in
this section), and in a manner which eliminates the need for
additional detention at any processing center of the Service
and in a manner which assures expeditious removal 273 fol-
lowing the end of the alien’s incarceration for the underlying

aggravated felony who is taken into custody by the Attorney Gen-
eral pursuant to section 236(c), 273 the Attorney General shall, to
the maximum extent practicable, detain any such felon at a facility
at which other such aliens are detained. In the selection of such fa-
cility, the Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to ensure
that the alien’s access to counsel and right to counsel under section
292 are not impaired.
(3) EXPEDITED 275 PROCEEDINGS.—(A) Notwithstanding any
other provision of law, the Attorney General shall provide for the
initiation and, to the extent possible, the completion of removal 273
proceedings, and any administrative appeals thereof, in the case of
any alien convicted of an aggravated felony before the alien’s re-
lease from incarceration for the underlying aggravated felony.
(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the
Attorney General to effect the removal 273 of any alien sentenced to

tion of the plea agreement or as a condition of probation or su-
pervised release, or both. The United States district court, in
both felony and misdemeanor cases, and a United States mag-
istrate judge in misdemeanor cases, may accept such a stipula-
tion and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of re-

onstrates that the failure to appear was because of ex-
ceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection

the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive
notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of sec-
tion 239(a) or the alien demonstrates that the alien
was in Federal or State custody and the failure to ap-
pear was through no fault of the alien.
The filing of the motion to reopen described in clause (i)

tice provided to the alien, (ii) the reasons for the alien’s
not attending the proceeding, and (iii) whether or not the

APPEAR.—Any alien against whom a final order of removal is
entered in absentia under this subsection and who, at the time

after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.
(c) D ECISION AND BURDEN OF PROOF.—
(1) DECISION.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—At the conclusion of the proceeding
the immigration judge shall decide whether an alien is re-
movable from the United States. The determination of the
immigration judge shall be based only on the evidence pro-
duced at the hearing.
(B) CERTAIN MEDICAL DECISIONS.—If a medical officer
or civil surgeon or board of medical officers has certified
under section 232(b) that an alien has a disease, illness, or
addiction which would make the alien inadmissible under
paragraph (1) of section 212(a), the decision of the immi-
gration judge shall be based solely upon such certification.
(2) BURDEN ON ALIEN.—In the proceeding the alien has the
burden of establishing—
(A) if the alien is an applicant for admission, that the
alien is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted
and is not inadmissible under section 212; or
(B) by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is
lawfully present in the United States pursuant to a prior
admission.
In meeting the burden of proof under subparagraph (B), the
alien shall have access to the alien’s visa or other entry docu-
ment, if any, and any other records and documents, not consid-
ered by the Attorney General to be confidential, pertaining to
the alien’s admission or presence in the United States.
(3) BURDEN ON SERVICE IN CASES OF DEPORTABLE ALIENS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—In the proceeding the Service has
the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evi-
dence that, in the case of an alien who has been admitted
to the United States, the alien is deportable. No decision
on deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon rea-
sonable, substantial, and probative evidence.

(i) An official record of judgment and conviction.
(ii) An official record of plea, verdict, and sen-
tence.
(iii) A docket entry from court records that indi-
cates the existence of the conviction.
(iv) Official minutes of a court proceeding or a
transcript of a court hearing in which the court takes
notice of the existence of the conviction.
(v) An abstract of a record of conviction prepared
by the court in which the conviction was entered, or
by a State official associated with the State’s reposi-
tory of criminal justice records, that indicates the
charge or section of law violated, the disposition of the
case, the existence and date of conviction, and the sen-
tence.
(vi) Any document or record prepared by, or under
the direction of, the court in which the conviction was
entered that indicates the existence of a conviction.
(vii) Any document or record attesting to the con-
viction that is maintained by an official of a State or
Federal penal institution, which is the basis for that
institution’s authority to assume custody of the indi-
vidual named in the record.
(C) ELECTRONIC RECORDS.—In any proceeding under
this Act, any record of conviction or abstract that has been
submitted by electronic means to the Service from a State
or court shall be admissible as evidence to prove a criminal
conviction if it is—
(i) certified by a State official associated with the
State’s repository of criminal justice records as an offi-
cial record from its repository or by a court official
from the court in which the conviction was entered as
an official record from its repository, and
(ii) certified in writing by a Service official as hav-
ing been received electronically from the State’s record
repository or the court’s record repository.
A certification under clause (i) may be by means of a com-
puter-generated signature and statement of authenticity.
(4) APPLICATIONS FOR RELIEF FROM REMOVAL.—

tection from removal has the burden of proof to establish
that the alien—
(i) satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements;
and (ii) with respect to any form of relief that is grant-
ed in the exercise of discretion, that the alien merits
a favorable exercise of discretion.
(B) SUSTAINING BURDEN.—The applicant must comply
with the applicable requirements to submit information or
documentation in support of the applicant’s application for

relief or protection as provided by law or by regulation or
in the instructions for the application form. In evaluating
the testimony of the applicant or other witness in support
of the application, the immigration judge will determine
whether or not the testimony is credible, is persuasive, and
refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the
applicant has satisfied the applicant’s burden of proof. In
determining whether the applicant has met such burden,
the immigration judge shall weigh the credible testimony
along with other evidence of record. Where the immigra-
tion judge determines that the applicant should provide
evidence which corroborates otherwise credible testimony,
such evidence must be provided unless the applicant dem-
onstrates that the applicant does not have the evidence
and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.
(C) CREDIBILITY DETERMINATION.—Considering the to-
tality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, the
immigration judge may base a credibility determination on
the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant
or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant’s or
witness’s account, the consistency between the applicant’s
or witness’s written and oral statements (whenever made
and whether or not under oath, and considering the cir-
cumstances under which the statements were made), the
internal consistency of each such statement, the consist-
ency of such statements with other evidence of record (in-
cluding the reports of the Department of State on country
conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such
statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency,
inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s
claim, or any other relevant factor. There is no presump-
tion of credibility, however, if no adverse credibility deter-
mination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness shall
have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.
(5) NOTICE.—If the immigration judge decides that the
alien is removable and orders the alien to be removed, the
judge shall inform the alien of the right to appeal that decision
and of the consequences for failure to depart under the order
of removal, including civil and criminal penalties.
(6) MOTIONS TO RECONSIDER.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The alien may file one motion to re-
consider a decision that the alien is removable from the
United States.
(B) DEADLINE.—The motion must be filed within 30
days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of
removal.
(C) CONTENTS.—The motion shall specify the errors of
law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by
pertinent authority.
(7) MOTIONS TO REOPEN.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—An alien may file one motion to re-
open proceedings under this section, except that this limi-
tation shall not apply so as to prevent the filing of one mo-
tion to reopen described in subparagraph (C)(iv).

‘‘SPOUSES, CHILDREN, AND PARENTS’’. The amendment was executed to reflect the probable intent
of Congress notwithstanding the problems with capitalization in the heading.
286 Subparagraph (C) of section 825(a)(2) of Public Law 109–162 (119 Stat. 3063) provides the
following amendment:
(C) in clause (iv)(I), by striking ‘‘or section 240A(b)’’ and inserting ‘‘, section 240A(b),

of a motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to
apply for relief under sections 208 or 241(b)(3) and is
based on changed country conditions arising in the
country of nationality or the country to which removal
has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was
not available and would not have been discovered or
presented at the previous proceeding.
(iii) FAILURE TO APPEAR.—The filing of a motion to
reopen an order entered pursuant to subsection (b)(5)
is subject to the deadline specified in subparagraph
(C) of such subsection.

204(a)(1)(A), clause (ii) or (iii) of section
204(a)(1)(B), or 240A(b)(2) 286 ;
(II) if the motion is accompanied by a can-
cellation of removal application to be filed with
the Attorney General or by a copy of the self-peti-

granting of the motion to reopen;
(III) if the motion to reopen is filed within 1

ney General’s discretion, waive this time limita-
tion in the case of an alien who demonstrates ex-
traordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to

lishes that the alien is a qualified alien.
(d) STIPULATED REMOVAL.—The Attorney General shall provide
by regulation for the entry by an immigration judge of an order of

treme cruelty by such permanent resident parent); or
(III) the alien has been battered or subjected to
extreme cruelty by a United States citizen or lawful
permanent resident whom the alien intended to
marry, but whose marriage is not legitimate because
of that United States citizen’s or lawful permanent
resident’s bigamy;
(ii) the alien has been physically present in the
United States for a continuous period of not less than
3 years immediately preceding the date of such appli-
cation, and the issuance of a charging document for re-

presence who is under 21 years of age, the spouse,
child, parent, or unmarried sibling under 18 years

and care for the alien until the alien arrives at the final des-
tination.
(2) COSTS.—The costs of providing the service described in
paragraph (1) shall be defrayed in the same manner as the ex-
pense of removing the accompanied alien is defrayed under
this section.

(1) IN GENERAL.—The Attorney General shall arrange for
appropriate places of detention for aliens detained pending re-
moval or a decision on removal. When United States Govern-
ment facilities are unavailable or facilities adapted or suitably

Naturalization Service—Salaries and Expenses’’, without re-
gard to section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5),

titioner’s nationality is presented, the court shall decide
the nationality claim.
(B) TRANSFER IF ISSUE OF FACT.—If the petitioner
claims to be a national of the United States and the court
of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about
the petitioner’s nationality is presented, the court shall
transfer the proceeding to the district court of the United
States for the judicial district in which the petitioner re-
sides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a de-
cision on that claim as if an action had been brought in
the district court under section 2201 of title 28, United
States Code.
(C) LIMITATION ON DETERMINATION.—The petitioner
may have such nationality claim decided only as provided
in this paragraph.
(6) CONSOLIDATION WITH REVIEW OF MOTIONS TO REOPEN
OR RECONSIDER.—When a petitioner seeks review of an order
under this section, any review sought of a motion to reopen or
reconsider the order shall be consolidated with the review of
the order.
(7) CHALLENGE TO VALIDITY OF ORDERS IN CERTAIN CRIMI-
NAL PROCEEDINGS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—If the validity of an order of removal
has not been judicially decided, a defendant in a criminal
proceeding charged with violating section 243(a) may chal-
lenge the validity of the order in the criminal proceeding
only by filing a separate motion before trial. The district
court, without a jury, shall decide the motion before trial.
(B) CLAIMS OF UNITED STATES NATIONALITY.—If the de-
fendant claims in the motion to be a national of the United
States and the district court finds that—
(i) no genuine issue of material fact about the de-
fendant’s nationality is presented, the court shall de-
cide the motion only on the administrative record on
which the removal order is based and the administra-
tive findings of fact are conclusive if supported by rea-
sonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the
record considered as a whole; or
(ii) a genuine issue of material fact about the de-
fendant’s nationality is presented, the court shall hold
a new hearing on the nationality claim and decide that
claim as if an action had been brought under section
2201 of title 28, United States Code.
The defendant may have such nationality claim decided
only as provided in this subparagraph.
(C) CONSEQUENCE OF INVALIDATION.—If the district
court rules that the removal order is invalid, the court
shall dismiss the indictment for violation of section 243(a).
The United States Government may appeal the dismissal
to the court of appeals for the appropriate circuit within 30
days after the date of the dismissal.
(D) L IMITATION ON FILING PETITIONS FOR REVIEW.—
The defendant in a criminal proceeding under section

243(a) may not file a petition for review under subsection
(a) during the criminal proceeding.
(8) CONSTRUCTION.—This subsection—
(A) does not prevent the Attorney General, after a
final order of removal has been issued, from detaining the
alien under section 241(a);
(B) does not relieve the alien from complying with sec-
tion 241(a)(4) and section 243(g); and
(C) does not require the Attorney General to defer re-
moval of the alien.
(9) CONSOLIDATION OF QUESTIONS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.—
Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, including inter-
pretation and application of constitutional and statutory provi-
sions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to
remove an alien from the United States under this title shall
be available only in judicial review of a final order under this
section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no court
shall have jurisdiction, by habeas corpus under section 2241 of
title 28, United States Code, or any other habeas corpus provi-
sion, by section 1361 or 1651 of such title, or by any other pro-
vision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), to review such an
order or such questions of law or fact.
(c) REQUIREMENTS FOR PETITION.—A petition for review or for
habeas corpus of an order of removal—
(1) shall attach a copy of such order, and
(2) shall state whether a court has upheld the validity of
the order, and, if so, shall state the name of the court, the date
of the court’s ruling, and the kind of proceeding.
(d) REVIEW OF FINAL ORDERS.—A court may review a final
order of removal only if—
(1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies
available to the alien as of right, and
(2) another court has not decided the validity of the order,
unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents
grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judi-
cial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the prior pro-
ceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the
order.
(e) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ORDERS UNDER SECTION 235(b)(1).—
(1) LIMITATIONS ON RELIEF.—Without regard to the nature
of the action or claim and without regard to the identity of the
party or parties bringing the action, no court may—
(A) enter declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable re-
lief in any action pertaining to an order to exclude an alien
in accordance with section 235(b)(1) except as specifically
authorized in a subsequent paragraph of this subsection,
or
(B) certify a class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure in any action for which judicial review
is authorized under a subsequent paragraph of this sub-
section.

ance of the evidence that the petitioner is an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence, has been admitted as a
refugee under section 207, or has been granted asylum
under section 208, such status not having been termi-
nated, and is entitled to such further inquiry as prescribed
by the Attorney General pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(C).
(3) CHALLENGES ON VALIDITY OF THE SYSTEM.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Judicial review of determinations
under section 235(b) and its implementation is available in
an action instituted in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia, but shall be limited to determina-
tions of—

to implement such section, is constitutional; or
(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy
directive, written policy guideline, or written proce-
dure issued by or under the authority of the Attorney
General to implement such section, is not consistent
with applicable provisions of this title or is otherwise
in violation of law.

be the duty of the District Court, the Court of Appeals,
and the Supreme Court of the United States to advance on
the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent
the disposition of any case considered under this para-
graph.
(4) DECISION.—In any case where the court determines
that the petitioner—
(A) is an alien who was not ordered removed under
section 235(b)(1), or
(B) has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evi-
dence that the alien is an alien lawfully admitted for per-
manent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under
section 207, or has been granted asylum under section 208,
the court may order no remedy or relief other than to re-
quire that the petitioner be provided a hearing in accord-
ance with section 240. Any alien who is provided a hearing
under section 240 pursuant to this paragraph may there-

after obtain judicial review of any resulting final order of
removal pursuant to subsection (a)(1).
(5) SCOPE OF INQUIRY.—In determining whether an alien
has been ordered removed under section 235(b)(1), the court’s
inquiry shall be limited to whether such an order in fact was
issued and whether it relates to the petitioner. There shall be
no review of whether the alien is actually inadmissible or enti-
tled to any relief from removal.
(f) L IMIT ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Regardless of the nature of the action or
claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the ac-
tion, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have juris-
diction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the
provisions of chapter 4 of title II, as amended by the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996,
other than with respect to the application of such provisions to
an individual alien against whom proceedings under such
chapter have been initiated.
(2) PARTICULAR CASES.—Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pur-
suant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows
by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of
such order is prohibited as a matter of law.

action brought pursuant to section 235(b)(3), subsections (e) or
(f) of section 236, or section 241(a)(2)(B).

tion and notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or
nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, United States
Code, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and
1651 of such title, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any
cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the deci-
sion or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings,
adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under
this Act.

alien;
(B) the effect of the alien’s release upon the national
security and public peace or safety;

(F) the eligibility of the alien for discretionary relief
under the immigration laws.
(b) WILLFUL FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH TERMS OF RELEASE

graph.
(2) CLEARING VESSELS AND AIRCRAFT.—
(A) CLEARANCE BEFORE DECISION ON LIABILITY.—A

sion on liability is made under paragraph (1) only if a bond
approved by the Attorney General or an amount sufficient
to pay the civil penalty is deposited with the Commis-
sioner.
(B) PROHIBITION ON CLEARANCE WHILE PENALTY UN-
PAID.—A vessel or aircraft may not be granted clearance if
a civil penalty imposed under paragraph (1) is not paid.
(d) DISCONTINUING GRANTING VISAS TO NATIONALS OF COUN-
TRY DENYING OR DELAYING ACCEPTING ALIEN.—On being notified
by the Attorney General that the government of a foreign country
denies or unreasonably delays accepting an alien who is a citizen,
subject, national, or resident of that country after the Attorney
General asks whether the government will accept the alien under
this section, the Secretary of State shall order consular officers in
that foreign country to discontinue granting immigrant visas or
nonimmigrant visas, or both, to citizens, subjects, nationals, and
residents of that country until the Attorney General notifies the
Secretary that the country has accepted the alien.
(e) ENFORCEMENT BY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF A STATE.—The at-
torney general of a State, or other authorized State officer, alleging
a violation of the requirement to discontinue granting visas to citi-
zens, subjects, nationals, and residents as described in subsection
(d) that harms such State or its residents shall have standing to
bring an action against the Secretary of State on behalf of such
State or the residents of such State in an appropriate district court
of the United States to obtain appropriate injunctive relief. The
court shall advance on the docket and expedite the disposition of
a civil action filed under this subsection to the greatest extent prac-
ticable. For purposes of this subsection, a State or its residents
shall be considered to have been harmed if the State or its resi-
dents experience harm, including financial harm in excess of $100.

as follows:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United
States of America, the Attorney General and Secretary of State are hereby ordered to exercise
their authority, including that under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101–1557),
as follows:
Section 1. The Attorney General is directed to take any steps necessary to defer until January
1, 1994, the enforced departure of all nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and their
dependents who were in the United States on or after June 5, 1989, up to and including the
date of this order (hereinafter ‘‘such PRC nationals’’).
Sec. 2. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed to take all steps nec-
essary with respect to such PRC nationals (1) to waive through January 1, 1994, the require-
ment of a valid passport and (2) to process and provide necessary documents, both within the
United States and at United States consulates overseas, to facilitate travel across the borders
of other nations and reentry into the United States in the same status such PRC nationals had
upon departure.
Sec. 3. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed to provide the following
protections:
(1) irrevocable waiver of the 2-year home country residence requirements that may be exer-
cised until January 1, 1994, for such PRC nationals;
(2) maintenance of lawful status for purposes of adjustment of status or change of non-
immigrant status for such PRC nationals who were in lawful status at any time on or after June
5, 1989, up to and including the date of this order;
(3) authorization for employment of such PRC nationals through January 1, 1994; and
(4) notice of expiration of nonimmigrant status (if applicable) rather than the institution of
deportation proceedings, and explanation of options available for such PRC nationals eligible for
deferral of enforced departure whose nonimmigrant status has expired.
Sec. 4. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed to provide for enhanced
consideration under the immigration laws for individuals from any country who express a fear
of persecution upon return to their country related to that country’s policy of forced abortion
or coerced sterilization, as implemented by the Attorney General’s regulation effective January
29, 1990.
Sec. 5. The Attorney General is directed to ensure that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service finalizes and makes public its position on the issue of training for individuals in F–1
visa status and on the issue of reinstatement into lawful nonimmigrant status of such PRC na-
tionals who have withdrawn their applications for asylum.
Sec. 6. The Departments of Justice and State are directed to consider other steps to assist
such PRC nationals in their efforts to utilize the protections that I have extended pursuant to
this order.
Sec. 7. This order shall be effective immediately.

bitually resided in such designated state) and who meets the
requirements of subsection (c), the Attorney General, in accord-
ance with this section—

the period the alien is in temporary protected status under this
section.
(3) NOTICE.—
(A) Upon the granting of temporary protected status
under this section, the Attorney General shall provide the
alien with information concerning such status under this
section.
(B) If, at the time of initiation of a removal 298 pro-
ceeding against an alien, the foreign state (of which the
alien is a national) is designated under subsection (b), the
Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the
temporary protected status that may be available under
this section.
(C) If, at the time of designation of a foreign state
under subsection (b), an alien (who is a national of such
state) is in a removal 298 proceeding under this title, the
Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the
temporary protected status that may be available under
this section.
(D) Notices under this paragraph shall be provided in
a form and language that the alien can understand.
(4) TEMPORARY TREATMENT FOR ELIGIBLE ALIENS.—
(A) In the case of an alien who can establish a prima
facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1),
but for the fact that the period of registration under sub-
section (c)(1)(A)(iv) has not begun, until the alien has had
a reasonable opportunity to register during the first 30
days of such period, the Attorney General shall provide for
the benefits of paragraph (1).
(B) In the case of an alien who establishes a prima
facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1),
until a final determination with respect to the alien’s eligi-
bility for such benefits under paragraph (1) has been
made, the alien shall be provided such benefits.
(5) CLARIFICATION.—Nothing in this section shall be con-
strued as authorizing the Attorney General to deny temporary
protected status to an alien based on the alien’s immigration
status or to require any alien, as a condition of being granted
such status, either to relinquish nonimmigrant or other status
the alien may have or to execute any waiver of other rights
under this Act. The granting of temporary protected status
under this section shall not be considered to be inconsistent
with the granting of nonimmigrant status under this Act.
(b) DESIGNATIONS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Attorney General, after consultation
with appropriate agencies of the Government, may designate
any foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) under this
subsection only if—

ing armed conflict within the state and, due to such con-
flict, requiring the return of aliens who are nationals of

that state to that state (or to the part of the state) would
pose a serious threat to their personal safety;
(B) the Attorney General finds that—
(i) there has been an earthquake, flood, drought,
epidemic, or other environmental disaster in the state
resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of
living conditions in the area affected,
(ii) the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to
handle adequately the return to the state of aliens
who are nationals of the state, and
(iii) the foreign state officially has requested des-
ignation under this subparagraph; or
(C) the Attorney General finds that there exist ex-
traordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state
that prevent aliens who are nationals of the state from re-
turning to the state in safety, unless the Attorney General
finds that permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in
the United States is contrary to the national interest of
the United States.
A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state)
under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice
of the designation (including a statement of the findings under
this paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is
published in the Federal Register. In such notice, the Attorney
General shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals
of the foreign state designated who are (or within the effective
period of the designation are likely to become) eligible for tem-
porary protected status under this section and their immigra-
tion status in the United States.
(2) EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF DESIGNATION FOR FOREIGN
STATES.—The designation of a foreign state (or part of such for-
eign state) under paragraph (1) shall—
(A) take effect upon the date of publication of the des-
ignation under such paragraph, or such later date as the
Attorney General may specify in the notice published
under such paragraph, and
(B) shall remain in effect until the effective date of the
termination of the designation under paragraph (3)(B).
For purposes of this section, the initial period of designation of
a foreign state (or part thereof) under paragraph (1) is the pe-
riod, specified by the Attorney General, of not less than 6
months and not more than 18 months.
(3) P ERIODIC REVIEW, TERMINATIONS, AND EXTENSIONS OF
DESIGNATIONS.—
(A) PERIODIC REVIEW.—At least 60 days before end of
the initial period of designation, and any extended period
of designation, of a foreign state (or part thereof) under
this section the Attorney General, after consultation with

General for adjustment of his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent resi-
dence.
(b) If, after consultation with the Secretary of State, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the
Attorney General that the alien has shown compelling reasons demonstrating both that the
alien is unable to return to the country represented by the government which accredited the
alien or the member of the alien’s immediate family and that adjustment of the alien’s status
to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence would be in the national interest,
that the alien is a person of good moral character, that he is admissible for permanent residence
under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and that such action would not be contrary to the
national welfare, safety, or security, the Attorney General, in his discretion, may record the
alien’s lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date the order of the Attorney Gen-
eral approving the application for adjustment of status is made.
(c) A complete and detailed statement of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the case

under the provisions of section 245 or 249 of this Act or any other
provision of law to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney Gen-
eral that the person was not in fact eligible for such adjustment of
status, the Attorney General shall rescind the action taken grant-
ing an adjustment of status to such person and cancelling re-
moval 338 in the case of such person if that occurred and the person
shall thereupon be subject to all provisions of this Act to the same
extent as if the adjustment of status had not been made. Nothing
in this subsection shall require the Attorney General to rescind the
alien’s status prior to commencement of procedures to remove the
alien under section 240, and an order of removal issued by an im-
migration judge shall be sufficient to rescind the alien’s status.
(b) Any person who has become a naturalized citizen of the
United States upon the basis of a record of a lawful admission for
permanent residence, created as a result of an adjustment of status
for which such person was not in fact eligible, and which is subse-
quently rescinded under subsection (a) of this section, shall be sub-
ject to the provisions of section 340 of this Act as a person whose
naturalization was procured by concealment of a material fact or
by willful misrepresentation.

in continuous and immediate transit through the United States (presumably without a visa—
see § 212(d)(4)).
ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS OF CERTAIN RESIDENT ALIENS TO
NONIMMIGRANT STATUS
SEC. 247. ø8 U.S.C. 1257¿ (a) The status of an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence shall be adjusted by the Attor-
ney General, under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that
of a nonimmigrant under paragraph (15)(A), (15)(E), or (15)(G) of
section 101(a), if such alien had at the time of admission 339 or sub-
sequently acquires an occupational status which would, if he were
seeking admission to the United States, entitle him to a non-
immigrant status under such sections. As of the date of the Attor-
ney General’s order making such adjustment of status, the Attor-
ney General shall cancel the record of the alien’s admission for per-
manent residence, and the immigrant status of such alien shall
thereby be terminated.
(b) The adjustment of status required by subsection (a) shall
not be applicable in the case of any alien who requests that he be
permitted to retain his status as an immigrant and who, in such
form as the Attorney General may require, executes and files with
the Attorney General a written waiver of all rights, privileges, ex-
emptions, and immunities under any law or any executive order
which would otherwise accrue to him because of the acquisition of
an occupational status entitling him to a nonimmigrant status
under paragraph (15)(A), (15)(E), or (15)(G) of section 101(a).
CHANGE OF NONIMMIGRANT CLASSIFICATION
SEC. 248. 340 ø8 U.S.C. 1258¿ (a) The Secretary of Homeland
Security may, under such conditions as he may prescribe, authorize
a change from any nonimmigrant classification to any other non-
immigrant classification in the case of any alien lawfully admitted
to the United States as a nonimmigrant who is continuing to main-
tain that status and who is not inadmissible under section
212(a)(9)(B)(i) (or whose inadmissibility under such section is
waived under section 212(a)(9)(B)(v)), except (subject to subsection
(b)) in the case of—
(1) an alien classified as a nonimmigrant under subpara-
graph (C), (D), (K), or (S) of section 101(a)(15),
(2) an alien classified as a nonimmigrant under subpara-
graph (J) of section 101(a)(15) who came to the United States
or acquired such classification in order to receive graduate
medical education or training,
(3) an alien (other than an alien described in paragraph
(2)) classified as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (J) of
section 101(a)(15) who is subject to the two-year foreign resi-
dence requirement of section 212(e) and has not received a

case of any alien, as of the date of the approval of his application
or, if entry occurred prior to July 1, 1924, as of the date of such
entry, if no such record is otherwise available and such alien shall
satisfy the Attorney General that he is not inadmissible under sec-
tion 212(a)(3)(E) 341 or under section 212(a) insofar as it relates to
criminals, procurers and other immoral persons, subversives, viola-
tors of the narcotic laws or smugglers of aliens, and he establishes
that he—
(a) entered the United States prior to January 1, 1972;
(b) has had his residence in the United States continuously
since such entry;
(c) is a person of good moral character; and
(d) is not ineligible to citizenship and is not deportable

REMOVAL OF ALIENS WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO DISTRESS
S EC. 250. ø8 U.S.C. 1260¿ The Attorney General may remove
from the United States any alien who falls into distress or who
needs public aid from causes arising subsequent to his entry, and
is desirous of being so removed, to the native country of such alien,
or to the country from which he came, or to the country of which
he is a citizen or subject, or to any other country to which he wish-
es to go and which will receive him, at the expense of the appro-
priation for the enforcement of this Act. Any alien so removed shall
be ineligible to apply for or receive a visa or other documentation
for readmission, or to apply for admission to the United States ex-
cept with the prior approval of the Attorney General.

those to be paid off or discharged in the port of arrival; or (2) in
the discretion of the Attorney General, such a list containing so
much of such information, or such additional or supplemental infor-
mation, as the Attorney General shall by regulations prescribe. In
the case of a vessel engaged solely in traffic on the Great Lakes,
Saint Lawrence River, and connecting waterways, such lists shall
be furnished at such times as the Attorney General may require.
(b) It shall be the duty of any owner, agent, consignee, master,
or commanding officer of any vessel or aircraft to report to an im-
migration officer, in writing, as soon as discovered, all cases in
which any alien crewman has illegally landed in the United States
from the vessel or aircraft, together with a description of such alien
and any information likely to lead to his apprehension.
(c) Before the departure of any vessel or aircraft from any port
in the United States, it shall be the duty of the owner, agent, con-
signee, master, or commanding officer thereof, to deliver to an im-
migration officer at that port (1) a list containing the names of all
alien employees who were not employed thereon at the time of the
arrival at that port but who will leave such port thereon at the
time of the departure of such vessel or aircraft and the names of
those, if any, who have been paid off or discharged, and of those,
if any, who have deserted or landed at that port, or (2) in the dis-
cretion of the Attorney General, such a list containing so much of
such information, or such additional or supplemental information,
as the Attorney General shall by regulations prescribe. In the case
of a vessel engaged solely in traffic on the Great Lakes, Saint Law-
rence River, and connecting waterways, such lists shall be fur-
nished at such times as the Attorney General may require.
(d) 343 In case any owner, agent, consignee, master, or com-

or reports of aliens, or to report cases of desertion or landing, as
required by subsections (a), (b), and (c), such owner, agent, con-
signee, master, or commanding officer shall, if required by the At-
torney General, pay to the Commissioner the sum of $200 for each
alien concerning whom such lists are not delivered or such reports
are not made as required in the preceding subsections. In the case
that any owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer of
a vessel shall secure services of an alien crewman described in sec-
tion 101(a)(15)(D)(i) to perform longshore work not included in the
normal operation and service on board the vessel under section
258, the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer
shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $5,000, and such fine
shall be a lien against the vessel. No such vessel or aircraft shall
be granted clearance from any port at which it arrives pending the
determination of the question of the liability to the payment of
such fine, and if such fine is imposed, while it remains unpaid. No
such fine shall be remitted or refunded. Clearance may be granted

CONDITIONAL PERMITS TO LAND TEMPORARILY
SEC. 252. ø8 U.S.C. 1282¿ (a) No alien crewman shall be per-
mitted to land temporarily in the United States except as provided
in this section, section 212(d)(3), section 212(d)(5), and section 253.
If an immigration officer finds upon examination that an alien
crewman is a nonimmigrant under paragraph (15)(D) of section
101(a) and is otherwise admissible and has agreed to accept such
permit, he may, in his discretion, grant the crewman a conditional
permit to land temporarily pursuant to regulations prescribed by
the Attorney General, subject to revocation in subsequent pro-
ceedings as provided in subsection (b), and for a period of time, in
any event, not to exceed—
(1) the period of time (not exceeding twenty-nine days)
during which the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived re-
mains in port, if the immigration officer is satisfied that the
crewman intends to depart on the vessel or aircraft on which
he arrived;
(2) twenty-nine days, if the immigration officer is satisfied
that the crewman intends to depart, within the period for
which he is permitted to land, on a vessel or aircraft other
than the one on which he arrived; or
(3) 180 days, if the immigration officer determines that the
crewman—
(A) intends to depart, within the period for which the
crewman is permitted to land, on the same vessel or on a
vessel or aircraft other than the vessel on which the crew-
man arrived; and
(B) will perform ship-to-ship liquid cargo transfer op-
erations to or from any other vessel engaged in foreign
trade during such period.
(b) Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Attorney Gen-
eral, any immigration officer may, in his discretion, if he deter-
mines that an alien is not a bona fide crewman, or does not intend
to depart on the vessel or aircraft which brought him, revoke the
conditional permit to land which was granted such crewman under
the provisions of subsection (a)(1), take such crewman into custody,
and require the master or commanding officer of the vessel or air-
craft on which the crewman arrived to receive and detain him on
board such vessel or aircraft, if practicable, and such crewman
shall be removed 344 from the United States at the expense of the
transportation line which brought him to the United States. Until
such alien is so removed, 344 any expenses of his detention shall be
borne by such transportation company. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to require the procedure prescribed in section

HOSPITAL TREATMENT OF ALIEN CREWMEN AFFLICTED WITH CERTAIN
DISEASES
SEC. 253. ø8 U.S.C. 1283¿ An alien crewman, including an
alien crewman ineligible for a conditional permit to land under sec-
tion 252(a), who is found on arrival in a port of the United States
to be afflicted with any of the disabilities or diseases mentioned in
section 255, shall be placed in a hospital designated by the immi-
gration officer in charge at the port of arrival and treated, all ex-
penses connected therewith, including burial in the event of death,
to be borne by the owner, agent, consignee, commanding officer, or
master of the vessel or aircraft, and not to be deducted from the
crewman’s wages. No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clear-
ance until such expenses are paid, or their payment appropriately
guaranteed, and the collector of customs is so notified by the immi-
gration officer in charge. An alien crewman suspected of being af-
flicted with any such disability or disease may be removed from the
vessel or aircraft on which he arrived to an immigration station,
or other appropriate place, for such observation as will enable the
examining surgeons to determine definitely whether or not he is so
afflicted, all expenses connected therewith to be borne in the man-
ner hereinbefore prescribed. In cases in which it appears to the sat-
isfaction of the immigration officer in charge that it will not be pos-
sible within a reasonable time to effect a cure, the return of the
alien crewman shall be enforced on, or at the expense of, the trans-
portation line on which he came, upon such conditions as the Attor-
ney General shall prescribe, to insure that the alien shall be prop-
erly cared for and protected, and that the spread of contagion shall
be guarded against.

to detain at a place specified by an immigration officer at the ex-
pense of the airline, any alien crewman employed thereon until an
immigration officer has completely inspected such alien crewman,
including a physical examination by the medical examiner, or (2)
to detain any alien crewman on board the vessel, or in the case of
an aircraft at a place specified by an immigration officer at the ex-
pense of the airline, after such inspection unless a conditional per-

quired to do so by an immigration officer, whether such removal 345
requirement is imposed before or after the crewman is permitted
to land temporarily under section 212(d)(5), 252, or 253, shall pay
to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000 346 for each alien crewman
in respect of whom any such failure occurs. No such vessel or air-
craft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the
liability to the payment of such fine, or while the fine remains un-
paid, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determina-
tion of such question upon the deposit of a sum sufficient to cover
such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment
thereof approved by the Commissioner. The Attorney General may,
upon application in writing therefor, mitigate such penalty to not
less than $500 346 for each alien crewman in respect of whom such
failure occurs, upon such terms as he shall think proper.
(b) Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations
issued by the Attorney General, proof that an alien crewman did
not appear upon the outgoing manifest of the vessel or aircraft on
which he arrived in the United States from any place outside
thereof, or that he was reported by the master or commanding offi-
cer of such vessel or aircraft as a deserter, shall be prima facie evi-
dence of a failure to detain or remove 347 such alien crewman.
(c) If the Attorney General finds that removal 347 of an alien
crewman under this section on the vessel or aircraft on which he
arrived is impracticable or impossible, or would cause undue hard-
ship to such alien crewman, he may cause the alien crewman to be
removed 347 from the port of arrival or any other port on another
vessel or aircraft of the same transportation line, unless the Attor-
ney General finds this to be impracticable. All expenses incurred
in connection with such removal, 347 including expenses incurred in
transferring an alien crewman from one place in the United States
to another under such conditions and safeguards as the Attorney
General shall impose, shall be paid by the owner or owners of the
vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States.
The vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived shall not be grant-
ed clearance until such expenses have been paid or their payment
guaranteed to the satisfaction of the Attorney General. An alien
crewman who is transferred within the United States in accordance
with this subsection shall not be regarded as having been landed
in the United States.

Attorney General, from an examination made by a medical officer
of the United States Public Health Service, and is so certified by
such officer, that any such alien was so afflicted at the time he was
shipped or engaged and taken on board such vessel or aircraft and
that the existence of such affliction might have been detected by
means of a competent medical examination at such time, the
owner, commanding officer, agent, consignee, or master thereof
shall pay for each alien so afflicted to the Commissioner the sum
of $1,000. 348 No vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pend-

ment of such sums, or while such sums remain unpaid, except that
clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such ques-
tion upon the deposit of an amount sufficient to cover such sums

to secure the payment thereof. Any such fine may, in the discretion
of the Attorney General, be mitigated or remitted.
DISCHARGE OF ALIEN CREWMEN
SEC. 256. ø8 U.S.C. 1286¿ It shall be unlawful for any person,

alien crewman, except an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, employed on board a vessel or aircraft arriving in the
United States without first having obtained the consent of the At-
torney General. If it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney
General that any alien crewman has been paid off or discharged in
the United States in violation of the provisions of this section, such
owner, agent, consignee, charterer, master, commanding officer, or
other person, shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000 349
for each such violation. No vessel or aircraft shall be granted clear-
ance pending the determination of the question of the liability to
the payment of such sums, or while such sums remain unpaid, ex-
cept that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of
such question upon the deposit of an amount sufficient to cover

cember 20, 1993¿ shall remain valid until 60 days after the date of issuance of final regulations
by the Secretary under this section.
(c) PREVAILING PRACTICE EXCEPTION.—(1) 352 Subsection (a)
shall not apply to a particular activity of longshore work in and
about a local port if—
(A)(i) there is in effect in the local port one or more collec-
tive bargaining agreements each covering at least 30 percent
of the number of individuals employed in performing longshore
work and (ii) each such agreement (covering such percentage
of longshore workers) permits the activity to be performed by
alien crewmen under the terms of such agreement; or
(B) there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect in
the local port covering at least 30 percent of the number of in-
dividuals employed in performing longshore work, and an em-
ployer of alien crewmen (or the employer’s designated agent or
representative) has filed with the Secretary of Labor at least
14 days before the date of performance of the activity (or later,
if necessary due to an unanticipated emergency, but not later
than the date of performance of the activity) an attestation set-
ting forth facts and evidence to show that—
(i) the performance of the activity by alien crewmen is
permitted under the prevailing practice of the particular
port as of the date of filing of the attestation and that the
use of alien crewmen for such activity—
(I) is not during a strike or lockout in the course
of a labor dispute, and
(II) is not intended or designed to influence an
election of a bargaining representative for workers in
the local port; and

owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer to
the bargaining representative of longshore workers in the
local port, or, where there is no such bargaining represent-
ative, notice of the attestation has been provided to
longshore workers employed at the local port.
In applying subparagraph (B) in the case of a particular activity of
longshore work consisting of the use of an automated self-unload-
ing conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel, the attes-
tation shall be required to be filed only if the Secretary of Labor
finds, based on a preponderance of the evidence which may be sub-
mitted by any interested party, that the performance of such par-
ticular activity is not described in clause (i) of such subparagraph.
(2) Subject to paragraph (4), an attestation under paragraph
(1) shall—
(A) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the
date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor, and

filed by the entity.
(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the
receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting an
entity’s failure to meet conditions attested to, an entity’s misrepre-

pletion of the process described in subparagraph (D).
(ii) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to
conduct an investigation with respect to a matter under the last

retary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1). If such a re-
quest is made, the employer shall be issued notice of such request
and shall respond within 14 days to the notice. If the Secretary
makes an initial determination that the complaining party’s posi-
tion is supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the
Secretary shall require immediately that the employer cease and
desist from such activities until completion of the process described

of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1).

(1) ATTESTATION AFTER EXAMINATION OF DOCUMENTA-
TION.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The person or entity must attest,
under penalty of perjury and on a form designated or es-
tablished by the Attorney General by regulation, that it
has verified that the individual is not an unauthorized
alien by examining—
(i) a document described in subparagraph (B), or
(ii) a document described in subparagraph (C) and
a document described in subparagraph (D).
A person or entity has complied with the requirement of
this paragraph with respect to examination of a document
if the document reasonably appears on its face to be gen-
uine. If an individual provides a document or combination
of documents that reasonably appears on its face to be gen-
uine and that is sufficient to meet the requirements of the
first sentence of this paragraph, nothing in this paragraph
shall be construed as requiring the person or entity to so-
licit the production of any other document or as requiring
the individual to produce such another document.
(B) DOCUMENTS ESTABLISHING BOTH EMPLOYMENT AU-
THORIZATION AND IDENTITY.—A document described in this
subparagraph is an individual’s—
(i) United States passport;
(ii) resident alien card, alien registration card, or
other document designated by the Attorney General, if
the document—
(I) contains a photograph of the individual
and such other personal identifying information
relating to the individual as the Attorney General

subsection,
(II) is evidence of authorization of employ-
ment in the United States, and
(III) contains security features to make it re-
sistant to tampering, counterfeiting, and fraudu-
lent use.
(C) DOCUMENTS EVIDENCING EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZA-
TION.—A document described in this subparagraph is an
individual’s—
(i) social security account number card (other than
such a card which specifies on the face that the
issuance of the card does not authorize employment in
the United States); or
(ii) other documentation evidencing authorization
of employment in the United States which the Attor-
ney General finds, by regulation, to be acceptable for
purposes of this section.
(D) DOCUMENTS ESTABLISHING IDENTITY OF INDI-
VIDUAL.—A document described in this subparagraph is an
individual’s—
(i) driver’s license or similar document issued for
the purpose of identification by a State, if it contains
a photograph of the individual or such other personal
identifying information relating to the individual as
the Attorney General finds, by regulation, sufficient
for purposes of this section; or
(ii) in the case of individuals under 16 years of age
or in a State which does not provide for issuance of an
identification document (other than a driver’s license)
referred to in clause (i), documentation of personal
identity of such other type as the Attorney General
finds, by regulation, provides a reliable means of iden-
tification.
(E) A UTHORITY TO PROHIBIT USE OF CERTAIN DOCU-
MENTS.—If the Attorney General finds, by regulation, that
any document described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) as
establishing employment authorization or identity does not
reliably establish such authorization or identity or is being
used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree, the Attorney
General may prohibit or place conditions on its use for
purposes of this subsection.
(2) I NDIVIDUAL ATTESTATION OF EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZA-
TION.—The individual must attest, under penalty of perjury on
the form designated or established for purposes of paragraph
(1), that the individual is a citizen or national of the United
States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or
an alien who is authorized under this Act or by the Attorney
General to be hired, recruited, or referred for such employ-
ment.

such form in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), the per-
son or entity must retain the form and make it available for

(d) EVALUATION AND CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
S YSTEM.—
(1) PRESIDENTIAL MONITORING AND IMPROVEMENTS IN SYS-
TEM.— (A) MONITORING.—The President shall provide for the
monitoring and evaluation of the degree to which the em-
ployment verification system established under subsection
(b) provides a secure system to determine employment eli-
gibility in the United States and shall examine the suit-
ability of existing Federal and State identification systems
for use for this purpose.
(B) IMPROVEMENTS TO ESTABLISH SECURE SYSTEM.—To
the extent that the system established under subsection
(b) is found not to be a secure system to determine employ-
ment eligibility in the United States, the President shall,
subject to paragraph (3) and taking into account the re-
sults of any demonstration projects conducted under para-
graph (4), implement such changes in (including additions
to) the requirements of subsection (b) as may be necessary
to establish a secure system to determine employment eli-
gibility in the United States. Such changes in the system
may be implemented only if the changes conform to the re-
quirements of paragraph (2).
(2) RESTRICTIONS ON CHANGES IN SYSTEM.—Any change the
President proposes to implement under paragraph (1) in the
verification system must be designed in a manner so the
verification system, as so changed, meets the following require-
ments: (A) RELIABLE DETERMINATION OF IDENTITY.—The sys-
tem must be capable of reliably determining whether—
(i) a person with the identity claimed by an em-
ployee or prospective employee is eligible to work, and
(ii) the employee or prospective employee is claim-
ing the identity of another individual.
(B) USING OF COUNTERFEIT-RESISTANT DOCUMENTS.—If
the system requires that a document be presented to or ex-
amined by an employer, the document must be in a form
which is resistant to counterfeiting and tampering.
(C) LIMITED USE OF SYSTEM.—Any personal informa-
tion utilized by the system may not be made available to
Government agencies, employers, and other persons except
to the extent necessary to verify that an individual is not
an unauthorized alien.
(D) PRIVACY OF INFORMATION.—The system must pro-
tect the privacy and security of personal information and
identifiers utilized in the system.
(E) LIMITED DENIAL OF VERIFICATION.—A verification
that an employee or prospective employee is eligible to be
employed in the United States may not be withheld or re-
voked under the system for any reason other than that the
employee or prospective employee is an unauthorized
alien.
(F) LIMITED USE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES.—
The system may not be used for law enforcement purposes,

other than for enforcement of this Act or sections 1001,
1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18, United States Code.
(G) RESTRICTION ON USE OF NEW DOCUMENTS.—If the
system requires individuals to present a new card or other
document (designed specifically for use for this purpose) at
the time of hiring, recruitment, or referral, then such docu-
ment may not be required to be presented for any purpose
other than under this Act (or enforcement of sections 1001,
1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18, United States Code) nor
to be carried on one’s person.

(i) HEARINGS AND REVIEW.—The Committees on
the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of
the Senate shall cause to have printed in the Congres-
sional Record the substance of any major change de-
scribed in subparagraph (D), shall hold hearings re-
specting the feasibility and desirability of imple-
menting such a change, and, within the two year pe-
riod before implementation, shall report to their re-

Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to be-
lieve that a person or entity is engaged in a pattern or practice
of employment, recruitment, or referral in violation of para-
graph (1)(A) or (2) of subsection (a), the Attorney General may
bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the
United States requesting such relief, including a permanent or
temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order against
the person or entity, as the Attorney General deems necessary.

SEC. 274B. ø8 U.S.C. 1324b¿ (a) PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINA-
TION BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN OR CITIZENSHIP STATUS.—
(1) GENERAL RULE.—It is an unfair immigration-related
employment practice for a person or other entity to discrimi-
nate against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien,
as defined in section 274A(h)(3)) with respect to the hiring, or
recruitment or referral for a fee, of the individual for employ-
ment or the discharging of the individual from employment—
(A) because of such individual’s national origin, or
(B) in the case of a protected individual (as defined in
paragraph (3)), because of such individual’s citizenship sta-
tus.
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply to—
(A) a person or other entity that employs three or
fewer employees,
(B) a person’s or entity’s discrimination because of an
individual’s national origin if the discrimination with re-
spect to that person or entity and that individual is cov-
ered under section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or
(C) discrimination because of citizenship status which
is otherwise required in order to comply with law, regula-
tion, or executive order, or required by Federal, State, or
local government contract, or which the Attorney General
determines to be essential for an employer to do business
with an agency or department of the Federal, State, or
local government.

vidual who—

1990, 104 Stat. 5054), applicable to unfair immigration-related employment practices occurring
at any time, changed the defined term from ‘‘citizen or intending citizen’’ to ‘‘protected indi-
vidual’’ and eliminated the requirement that an alien evidence an intention to become a citizen
through completing a declaration of intention to become a citizen.
382 Paragraph (5) was added by § 534(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (P.L. 101–649, Nov.

nent residence, is granted the status of an alien lawfully
admitted for temporary residence under section 210(a) or
245A(a)(1), is admitted as a refugee under section 207, or
is granted asylum under section 208; but does not include
(i) an alien who fails to apply for naturalization within six
months of the date the alien first becomes eligible (by vir-
tue of period of lawful permanent residence) to apply for
naturalization or, if later, within six months after the date
of the enactment of this section and (ii) an alien who has
applied on a timely basis, but has not been naturalized as
a citizen within 2 years after the date of the application,
unless the alien can establish that the alien is actively
pursuing naturalization, except that time consumed in the
Service’s processing the application shall not be counted
toward the 2-year period.
(4) ADDITIONAL EXCEPTION PROVIDING RIGHT TO PREFER
EQUALLY QUALIFIED CITIZENS.—Notwithstanding any other pro-
vision of this section, it is not an unfair immigration-related
employment practice for a person or other entity to prefer to
hire, recruit, or refer an individual who is a citizen or national
of the United States over another individual who is an alien
if the two individuals are equally qualified.
(5) 382 PROHIBITION OF INTIMIDATION OR RETALIATION.—It
is also an unfair immigration-related employment practice for
a person or other entity to intimidate, threaten, coerce, or re-
taliate against any individual for the purpose of interfering
with any right or privilege secured under this section or be-
cause the individual intends to file or has filed a charge or a
complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in
an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this section. An
individual so intimidated, threatened, coerced, or retaliated
against shall be considered, for purposes of subsections (d) and
(g), to have been discriminated against.
(6) 383 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTARY PRACTICES AS
EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.—A person’s or other entity’s request,
for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 274A(b),
for more or different documents than are required under such
section or refusing to honor documents tendered that on their
face reasonably appear to be genuine shall be treated as an un-
fair immigration-related employment practice if made for the
purpose or with the intent of discriminating against an indi-
vidual in violation of paragraph (1).

ment practice) on the person or entity involved within 10 days.

own initiative, conduct investigations respecting unfair immi-
gration-related employment practices and, based on such an in-
vestigation and subject to paragraph (3), file a complaint before
such a judge.
(2) 385 PRIVATE ACTIONS.—If the Special Counsel, after re-
ceiving such a charge respecting an unfair immigration-related
employment practice which alleges knowing and intentional
discriminatory activity or a pattern or practice of discrimina-
tory activity, has not filed a complaint before an administrative
law judge with respect to such charge within such 120-day pe-
riod, the Special Counsel shall notify the person making the
charge of the determination not to file such a complaint during
such period and the person making the charge may (subject to
paragraph (3)) file a complaint directly before such a judge
within 90 days after the date of receipt of the notice. The Spe-
cial Counsel’s failure to file such a complaint within such 120-
day period shall not affect the right of the Special Counsel to
investigate the charge or to bring a complaint before an admin-
istrative law judge during such 90-day period.
(3) TIME LIMITATIONS ON COMPLAINTS.—No complaint may
be filed respecting any unfair immigration-related employment
practice occurring more than 180 days prior to the date of the

or entity has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair im-
migration-related employment practice, an administrative law

such person or entity a copy of the complaint and a notice of
hearing before the judge at a place therein fixed, not less than
five days after the serving of the complaint. Any such com-
plaint may be amended by the judge conducting the hearing,
upon the motion of the party filing the complaint, in the
judge’s discretion at any time prior to the issuance of an order

lated employment practice shall be considered a party to any
complaint before an administrative law judge respecting such

person may be allowed to intervene in the proceeding and to
present testimony.

ducting investigations and hearings under this subsection 386
and in accordance with regulations of the Attorney General,
the Special Counsel and administrative law judges shall have
reasonable access to examine evidence of any person or entity
being investigated. The administrative law judges by subpoena
may compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of
evidence at any designated place or hearing. In case of contu-
macy or refusal to obey a subpoena lawfully issued under this
paragraph and upon application of the administrative law
judge, an appropriate district court of the United States may
issue an order requiring compliance with such subpoena and
any failure to obey such order may be punished by such court
as a contempt thereof.
(g) DETERMINATIONS.—
(1) O RDER.—The administrative law judge shall issue and
cause to be served on the parties to the proceeding an order,
which shall be final unless appealed as provided under sub-
section (i).
(2) ORDERS FINDING VIOLATIONS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—If, upon the preponderance of the
evidence, an administrative law judge determines that any
person or entity named in the complaint has engaged in or
is engaging in any such unfair immigration-related em-
ployment practice, then the judge shall state his findings
of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such per-
son or entity an order which requires such person or entity
to cease and desist from such unfair immigration-related
employment practice.

(1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that
may have been available to seek relief against the order;
(2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was
issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for ju-
dicial review; and
(3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.

tions and limitations as the Attorney General shall prescribe.

officials, the Attorney General shall effectively and expeditiously
take custody of the alien.

427 Sec. 301IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT
431 Section 506(b) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands in Political Union with the United States, shown in Appendix V.A.1., made this section
applicable to children born abroad to United States citizen or non-citizen national parents per-
manently residing in the Northern Mariana Islands.
432 H ISTORICAL N OTE.—Previous to 1978, section 301 required that a person born abroad of
a U.S. citizen parent and an alien parent must be physically present in the United States for
a particular period of time in order to retain United States citizenship. Subsection (b) of this
section provided for a five-year period of continuous residence as follows:
(b) Any person who is a national and citizen of the United States at birth under paragraph
(7) of subsection (a), shall lose his nationality and citizenship unless he shall come to the United
States prior to attaining the age of twenty-three years and shall immediately following any such
coming be continuously physically present in the United State[s] for at least five years: Pro-
vided, That such physical presence follows the attainment of the age of fourteen years and pre-
cedes the age of twenty-eight years.
Subsection (c) of this section clarified that this requirement only applied to aliens born abroad
after May 24, 1934:
(c) Subsection (b) shall apply to a person born abroad subsequent to May 24, 1934: Provided,
however, That nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to alter or affect the citi-
zenship of any person born abroad subsequent to May 24, 1934, who, prior to the effective date
of this Act, has taken up a residence in the United States before attaining the age of sixteen
years, and thereafter, whether before or after the effective date of this Act, complies or shall
comply with the residence requirements for retention of citizenship specified in subsections (g)
and (h) of section 201 of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended.
Section 16 of the Act of September 11, 1957 (71 Stat. 644) provided a rule for determining
continuity of residence as follows: ‘‘In the administration of section 301(b) of the Immigration
Continued
(b) DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS NO LONGER REQUIRED.—As soon
as practicable after the proceeds from an undercover investigative
operation, carried out under paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection
(a), are no longer necessary for the conduct of the operation, the
proceeds or the balance of the proceeds remaining at the time shall
be deposited into the Treasury of the United States as miscella-
neous receipts.
(c) D ISPOSITION OF CERTAIN CORPORATIONS AND BUSINESS EN-
TITIES.—If a corporation or business entity established or acquired
as part of an undercover operation under paragraph (2) of sub-
section (a) with a net value of over $50,000 is to be liquidated, sold,
or otherwise disposed of, the Service, as much in advance as the
Commissioner or Commissioner’s designee determines practicable,
shall report the circumstances to the Attorney General, the Direc-
tor of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Comptroller
General. The proceeds of the liquidation, sale, or other disposition,
after obligations are met, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the
United States as miscellaneous receipts.
(d) F INANCIAL AUDITS.—The Service shall conduct detailed fi-
nancial audits of closed undercover operations on a quarterly basis
and shall report the results of the audits in writing to the Deputy
Attorney General.

and Nationality Act, absences from the United States of less than twelve months in the aggre-
gate, during the period for which continuous physical presence in the United States is required,
shall not be considered to break the continuity of such physical presence.’’
Public Law 92–584 (Oct. 27, 1972, 86 Stat. 1289) amended these provisions by rewriting sub-
section (b) to provide for only a two year residency requirement as follows:
(b) Any person who is a national and citizen of the United States under paragraph (7) of sub-
section (a) shall lose his nationality and citizenship unless—(1) he shall come to the United
States and be continuously physically present therein for a period of not less than two years
between the ages of fourteen years and twenty-eight years; or (2) the alien parent is naturalized
while the child is under the age of eighteen years and the child begins to reside permanently
in the United States while under the age of eighteen years. In the administration of this sub-
section absences from the United States of less than sixty days in the aggregate during the pe-
riod for which continuous physical presence in the United States is required shall not break the
continuity of such physical presence.
That Public Law also repealed section 16 of the Act of September 11, 1957, and added a new
subsection (d), as a savings clause for those complying with the previous law:
(d) Nothing contained in subsection (b), as amended, shall be construed to alter or affect the
citizenship of any person who has come to the United States prior to the effective date of this
subsection and who, whether before or after the effective date of this subsection, immediately
following such coming complies or shall comply with the physical presence requirements for re-
tention of citizenship specified in subsection (b) prior to its amendment and the repeal of section
16 of the Act of September 11, 1957.
These amendments applied to aliens born abroad after May 24, 1934.
The first section of Public Law 95–432 (Oct. 10, 1978, 92 Stat 1046), effective October 10,
1978, repealed subsections (b), (c), and (d), thus eliminating the residence requirement for reten-
tion of United States citizenship. This change was effective on October 10, 1978, and is prospec-
tive in nature (viz., it does not reinstate as citizens those who had lost citizenship under section
301(b) as previously in effect). See H. Rept. 95–1493 (95th Cong.), to accompany H.R. 13349,
p. 2.
433 The Act of March 16, 1956 (70 Stat. 50; 8 U.S.C. 1401a), provides as follows:
That section 301(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act shall be considered to have been
and to be applicable to a child born outside of the United States and its outlying possessions
(a) a person born in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof;
(b) a person born in the United States to a member of an
Indian, Eskimo, Aleutian, or other aboriginal tribe: Provided,
That the granting of citizenship under this subsection shall not
in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of such per-
son to tribal or other property;
(c) a person born outside of the United States and its out-
lying possessions of parents both of whom are citizens of the
United States and one of whom has had a residence in the
United States or one of its outlying possessions, prior to the
birth of such person;
(d) a person born outside of the United States and its out-
lying possessions of parents one of whom is a citizen of the
United States who has been physically present in the United
States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period
of one year prior to the birth of such person, and the other of
whom is a national, but not a citizen of the United States;
(e) a person born in an outlying possession of the United

who has been physically present in the United States or one

at any time prior to the birth of such person;
(f) a person of unknown parentage found in the United
States while under the age of five years, until shown, prior to

Technical Corrections Act of 1994 (P.L. 103–416, 108 Stat. 4306, Oct. 25, 1994); subsections (b)

nationality if the person failed to come to, or reside or be physically present in, the United
States shall not apply in the case of a person claiming United States citizenship based on such
person’s descent from an individual described in section 301(h) of the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act (as added by subsection (a)).
(c) RETROACTIVE A PPLICATION.—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the immigration and
nationality laws of the United States shall be applied (to persons born before, on, or after the

section (b), had been in effect as of the date of their birth, except that the retroactive application
of the amendment and that subsection shall not affect the validity of citizenship of anyone who
has obtained citizenship under section 1993 of the Revised Statutes (as in effect before the en-
actment of the Act of May 24, 1934 (48 Stat. 797)).
(2) The retroactive application of the amendment made by subsection (a), and subsection (b),

APPLICATION FOR NATURALIZATION; DECLARATION OF INTENTION
S EC. 334. ø8 U.S.C. 1445¿ (a) An applicant for naturalization
shall make and file with the Attorney General a sworn application
in writing, signed by the applicant in the applicant’s own hand-
writing, if physically able to write, which application shall be on a
form prescribed by the Attorney General and shall include aver-
ments of all facts which in the opinion of the Attorney General may
be material to the applicant’s naturalization, and required to be
proved under this title. In 464 the case of an applicant subject to a
requirement of continuous residence under section 316(a) or 319(a),
the application for naturalization may be filed up to 3 months be-
fore the date the applicant would first otherwise meet such contin-
uous residence requirement.
(b) No person shall file a valid application for naturalization
unless he shall have attained the age of eighteen years. An applica-
tion for naturalization by an alien shall contain an averment of
lawful admission for permanent residence.

ralization shall be held at regular intervals specified by the Attor-
ney General.
(d) Except as provided in subsection (e), an application for nat-
uralization shall be filed in the office of the Attorney General.
(e) A person may file an application for naturalization other
than in the office of the Attorney General, and an oath of alle-
giance administered other than in a public ceremony before the At-
torney General or a court, if the Attorney General determines that
the person has an illness or other disability which—
(1) is of a permanent nature and is sufficiently serious to
prevent the person’s personal appearance, or
(2) is of a nature which so incapacitates the person as to
prevent him from personally appearing.
(f) An alien over 18 years of age who is residing in the United
States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence
may file with the Attorney General a declaration of intention to be-
come a citizen of the United States. Such a declaration shall be
filed in duplicate and in a form prescribed by the Attorney General
and shall be accompanied by an application prescribed and ap-
proved by the Attorney General. Nothing in this subsection shall
be construed as requiring any such alien to make and file a dec-
laration of intention as a condition precedent to filing an applica-
tion for naturalization nor shall any such declaration of intention
be regarded as conferring or having conferred upon any such alien
United States citizenship or nationality or the right to United
States citizenship or nationality, nor shall such declaration be re-
garded as evidence of such alien’s lawful admission for permanent
residence in any proceeding, action, or matter arising under this or
any other Act.

INVESTIGATION OF APPLICANTS; EXAMINATIONS OF APPLICATIONS
S EC. 335. ø8 U.S.C. 1446¿ (a) Before a person may be natural-
ized, an employee of the Service, or of the United States designated
by the Attorney General, shall conduct a personal investigation of
the person applying for naturalization in the vicinity or vicinities
in which such person has maintained his actual place of abode and
in the vicinity or vicinities in which such person has been employed
or has engaged in business or work for at least five years imme-
diately preceding the filing of his application for naturalization.
The Attorney General may, in his discretion, waive a personal in-
vestigation in an individual case or in such cases or classes of cases
as may be designated by him.
(b) The Attorney General shall designate employees of the
Service to conduct examinations upon applications for naturaliza-
tion. For such purposes any such employee so designated is hereby
authorized to take testimony concerning any matter touching or in
any way affecting the admissibility of any applicant for naturaliza-
tion, to administer oaths, including the oath of the applicant for
naturalization, and to require by subpena the attendance and testi-
mony of witnesses, including applicant, before such employee so
designated and the production of relevant books, papers, and docu-
ments, and to that end may invoke the aid of any district court of
the United States; and any such court may, in the event of neglect
or refusal to respond to a subpena issued by any such employee so
designated or refusal to testify before such employee so designated
issue an order requiring such person to appear before such em-
ployee so designated, produce relevant books, papers, and docu-
ments if demanded, and testify; and any failure to obey such order
of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.
The record of the examination authorized by this subsection shall
be admissible as evidence in any hearing conducted by an immigra-
tion officer under section 336(a). Any 465 such employee shall, at
the examination, inform the applicant of the remedies available to
the applicant under section 336.
(c) The record of the examination upon any application for nat-
uralization may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be
transmitted to the Attorney General and the determination with
respect thereto of the employee designated to conduct such exam-
ination shall when made also be transmitted to the Attorney Gen-
eral.(d) The employee designated to conduct any such examination
shall make a determination as to whether the application should
be granted or denied, with reasons therefor.
(e) After an application for naturalization has been filed with
the Attorney General, the applicant shall not be permitted to with-
draw his application, except with the consent of the Attorney Gen-
eral. In cases where the Attorney General does not consent to the
withdrawal of the application, the application shall be determined
on its merits and a final order determination made accordingly. In
cases where the applicant fails to prosecute his application, the ap-

eral dismisses it for lack of prosecution.
(f) An applicant for naturalization who moves from the district
of the Service in the United States in which the application is
pending may, at any time thereafter, request the Service to trans-
fer the application to any district of the Service in the United
States which may act on the application. The transfer shall not be
made without the consent of the Attorney General. In the case of
such a transfer, the proceedings on the application shall continue
as though the application had originally been filed in the district
of the Service to which the application is transferred.
HEARINGS ON DENIALS OF APPLICATIONS FOR NATURALIZATION 466
SEC. 336. ø8 U.S.C. 1447¿ (a) If, after an examination under
section 335, an application for naturalization is denied, the appli-
cant may request a hearing before an immigration officer.
(b) If there is a failure to make a determination under section
335 before the end of the 120-day period after the date on which
the examination is conducted under such section, the applicant
may apply to the United States district court for the district in
which the applicant resides for a hearing on the matter. Such court
has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the mat-
ter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the
Service to determine the matter.
(c) The Attorney General shall have the right to appear before
any immigration officer in any naturalization proceedings for the
purpose of cross-examining the applicant and the witnesses pro-
duced in support of the application concerning any matter touching
or in any way affecting the applicant’s right to admission to citizen-
ship, and shall have the right to call witnesses, including the appli-
cant, produce evidence, and be heard in opposition to, or in favor
of, the granting of any application in naturalization proceedings.
(d) The immigration officer shall, if the applicant requests it at
the time of filing the request for the hearing, issue a subpena for
the witnesses named by such applicant to appear upon the day set
for the hearing, but in case such witnesses cannot be produced
upon the hearing other witnesses may be summoned upon notice
to the Attorney General, in such manner and at such time as the
Attorney General may by regulation prescribe. Such subpenas may
be enforced in the same manner as subpenas under section 335(b)
may be enforced.
(e) It shall be lawful at the time and as a part of the adminis-
tration by a court of the oath of allegiance under section 337(a) for
the court, in its discretion, upon the bona fide prayer of the appli-
cant included in an appropriate petition to the court, to make a de-
cree changing the name of said person, and the certificate of natu-
ralization shall be issued in accordance therewith.

467 Section 2 of the Act of Feb. 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 154) provides that ‘‘Either at the time of
the rendition of the decree of naturalization or at such other time as the judge may fix, the
judge or someone designated by him shall address the newly naturalized citizen upon the form
and genius of our Government and the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship; it being the
intent and purpose of this section to enlist the aid of the judiciary, in cooperation with civil and
educational authorities, and patriotic organizations in a continuous effort to dignify and empha-
size the significance of citizenship.’’.
OATH OF RENUNCIATION AND ALLEGIANCE
SEC. 337. ø8 U.S.C. 1448¿ (a) A person who has applied for
naturalization shall, in order to be and before being admitted to
citizenship, take in a public ceremony before the Attorney General
or a court with jurisdiction under section 310(b) an oath 467 (1) to
support the Constitution of the United States; (2) to renounce and
abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance and fidelity to any for-
eign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which the
applicant was before a subject or citizen; (3) to support and defend
the Constitution and the laws of the United States against all en-
emies, foreign and domestic; (4) to bear true faith and allegiance
to the same; and (5) (A) to bear arms on behalf of the United States
when required by the law, or (B) to perform noncombatant service
in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the
law, or (C) to perform work of national importance under civilian
direction when required by the law. Any such person shall be re-
quired to take an oath containing the substance of clauses (1)
through (5) of the preceding sentence, except that a person who
shows by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the
Attorney General that he is opposed to the bearing of arms in the
Armed Forces of the United States by reason of religious training
and belief shall be required to take an oath containing the sub-
stance of clauses (1) through (4) and clauses (5)(B) and (5)(C), and
a person who shows by clear and convincing evidence to the satis-
faction of the Attorney General that he is opposed to any type of
service in the Armed Forces of the United States by reason of reli-
gious training and belief shall be required to take an oath con-
taining the substance of clauses (1) through (4) and clause (5)(C).
The term ‘‘religious training and belief’’ as used in this section
shall mean an individual’s belief in a relation to a Supreme Being
involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation,
but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philo-
sophical views or a merely personal moral code. In the case of the
naturalization of a child under the provisions of section 322 of this
title the Attorney General may waive the taking of the oath if in
the opinion of the Attorney General the child is unable to under-
stand its meaning. The Attorney General may waive the taking of
the oath by a person if in the opinion of the Attorney General the
person is unable to understand, or to communicate an under-
standing of, its meaning because of a physical or developmental
disability or mental impairment. If the Attorney General waives
the taking of the oath by a person under the preceding sentence,
the person shall be considered to have met the requirements of sec-
tion 316(a)(3) with respect to attachment to the principles of the
Constitution and well disposition to the good order and happiness
of the United States.

any hereditary title, or has been of any of the orders of nobility in
any foreign state, the applicant shall in addition to complying with
the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, make under oath
in the same public ceremony in which the oath of allegiance is ad-
ministered, an express renunciation of such title or order of nobil-
ity, and such renunciation shall be recorded as a part of such pro-

or a member of the applicant’s immediate family, permanent dis-
ability sufficiently incapacitating as to prevent the applicant’s per-
sonal appearance at the scheduled ceremony, developmental dis-
ability or advanced age, or exigent circumstances relating to travel
or employment). If an expedited judicial oath administration cere-
mony is impracticable, the court shall refer such individual to the
Attorney General who may provide for immediate administrative
naturalization.

to ensure that the ceremonies conducted by the Attorney General
for the administration of oaths of allegiance under this section are
public, conducted frequently and at regular intervals, and are in
keeping with the dignity of the occasion.

all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness; and whereas in the recognition of this principle this Government has freely received emi-
grants from all nations, and invested them with the rights of citizenship; and whereas it is
claimed that such American citizens, with their descendants, are subjects of foreign states,
owing allegiance to the governments thereof; and whereas it is necessary to the maintenance
of public peace that this claim of foreign allegiance should be promptly and finally disavowed:
Therefore any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officer of the United
States which denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is declared incon-
sistent with the fundamental principles of the Republic.’’.

claiming that such loss occurred, to establish such claim by a pre-
ponderance of the evidence. Any person who commits or performs,
or who has committed or performed, any act of expatriation under

done so voluntarily, but such presumption may be rebutted upon
a showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the act or acts
committed or performed were not done voluntarily.

(2) is in issue in any such removal proceeding. An action under this
subsection may be instituted only within five years after the final
administrative denial of such right or privilege and shall be filed
in the district court of the United States for the district in which
such person resides or claims a residence, and jurisdiction over
such officials in such cases is hereby conferred upon those courts.
(b) If any person who is not within the United States claims
a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied
such right or privilege by any department or independent agency,

United States, such person may make application to a diplomatic
or consular officer of the United States in the foreign country in
which he is residing for a certificate of identity for the purpose of
traveling to a port of entry in the United States and applying for
admission. Upon proof to the satisfaction of such diplomatic or con-
sular officer that such application is made in good faith and has
a substantial basis, he shall issue to such person a certificate of
identity. From any denial of an application for such certificate the
applicant shall be entitled to an appeal to the Secretary of State,
who, if he approves the denial, shall state in writing his reasons
for his decision. The Secretary of State shall prescribe rules and
regulations for the issuance of certificates of identity as above pro-
vided. The provisions of this subsection shall be applicable only to
a person who at some time prior to his application for the certifi-
cate of identity has been physically present in the United States,
or to a person under sixteen years of age who was born abroad of
a United States citizen parent.
(c) A person who has been issued a certificate of identity under
the provisions of subsection (b), and while in possession thereof,
may apply for admission to the United States at any port of entry,
and shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act relating to the
conduct of proceedings involving aliens seeking admission to the
United States. A final determination by the Attorney General that
any such person is not entitled to admission to the United States
shall be subject to review by any court of competent jurisdiction in
habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise. Any person described
in this section who is finally denied admission to the United States

(B) It is the intent of Congress that in providing refugee assist-
ance under this section—
(i) employable refugees should be placed on jobs as soon as
possible after their arrival in the United States;
(ii) social service funds should be focused on employment-
related services, English-as-a-second-language training (in non-
work hours where possible), and case-management services;
and (iii) local voluntary agency activities should be conducted
in close cooperation and advance consultation with State and
local governments.
(2)(A) The Director and the Federal agency administering sub-
section (b)(1) shall consult regularly (not less often than quarterly)
with State and local governments and private nonprofit voluntary
agencies concerning the sponsorship process and the intended dis-
tribution of refugees among the States and localities before their
placement in those States and localities.
(B) The Director shall develop and implement, in consultation
with representatives of voluntary agencies and State and local gov-
ernments, policies and strategies for the placement and resettle-
ment of refugees within the United States.
(C) Such policies and strategies, to the extent practicable and
except under such unusual circumstances as the Director may rec-
ognize, shall—
(i) insure that a refugee is not initially placed or resettled
in an area highly impacted (as determined under regulations
prescribed by the Director after consultation with such agen-
cies and governments) by the presence of refugees or com-
parable populations unless the refugee has a spouse, parent,
sibling, son, or daughter residing in that area,
(ii) provide for a mechanism whereby representatives of
local affiliates of voluntary agencies regularly (not less often
than quarterly) meet with representatives of State and local
governments to plan and coordinate in advance of their arrival
the appropriate placement of refugees among the various
States and localities, and
(iii) take into account—
(I) the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants
in the population in the area,
(II) the availability of employment opportunities, af-
fordable housing, and public and private resources (includ-
ing educational, health care, and mental health services)
for refugees in the area,
(III) the likelihood of refugees placed in the area be-
coming self-sufficient and free from long-term dependence
on public assistance, and
(IV) the secondary migration of refugees to and from
the area that is likely to occur.
(D) With respect to the location of placement of refugees within
a State, the Federal agency administering subsection (b)(1) shall,
consistent with such policies and strategies and to the maximum
extent possible, take into account recommendations of the State.
(3) In the provision of domestic assistance under this section,
the Director shall make a periodic assessment, based on refugee

be made to those agencies which the appropriate administering of-
ficial determines can best perform the services. Payments may be
made for activities authorized under this chapter in advance or by
way of reimbursement. In carrying out this section, the Director,

of any kind made available by gift, devise, bequest, grant, or
otherwise for the purpose of carrying out this section.

under subsection (b)(5),
(ii) for services for refugees under subsection (c)(1),
(iii) for targeted assistance project grants under subsection
(c)(2), and
(iv) for assistance for refugee children under subsection
(d)(2).
(C) The Director may not delegate to a State or political sub-
division his authority to review or approve grants or contracts
under this chapter or the terms under which such grants or con-
tracts are made.
(5) Assistance and services funded under this section shall be
provided to refugees without regard to race, religion, nationality,
sex, or political opinion.
(6) As a condition for receiving assistance under this section,
a State must—
(A) submit to the Director a plan which provides—
(i) a description of how the State intends to encourage
effective refugee resettlement and to promote economic
self-sufficiency as quickly as possible,

(2)(A) The Director is authorized to make grants to States for
assistance to counties and similar areas in the States where, be-

demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available re-
sources for services to refugees.
(B) Grants shall be made available under this paragraph—
(i) primarily for the purpose of facilitating refugee employ-
ment and achievement of self-sufficiency,

of title IV of the Social Security Act prescribes for the availability
of such services to any other child in that State).
(ii) The Director shall attempt to arrange for the placement
under the laws of the States of such unaccompanied refugee chil-
dren, who have been accepted for admission to the United States,
before (or as soon as possible after) their arrival in the United
States. During any interim period while such a child is in the
United States or in transit to the United States but before the child

provides as follows:
(c) Notwithstanding section 412(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and in lieu of
any assistance which may otherwise be provided under such section with respect to Cuban refu-
gees who entered the United States and were receiving assistance under section 2(b) of the Mi-

associated with such Cuban refugees with respect to whom supplemental security income
payments were being paid as of September 30, 1978, under title XVI of the Social Security
Act.
487 For aliens who enter the United States as refugees before April 1, 1987, the following sen-
tence (which was stricken by § 9(a)(1) of the Refugee Assistance Extension Act of 1986 (Pub. L.
99–605, Nov. 6, 1986, 100 Stat. 3454)) applies:
Such cash assistance provided to such a refugee shall be terminated (after opportunity for an
administrative hearing) with the month in which the refugee refuses such an appropriate offer
of employment or refuses to participate in such an available and appropriate social service pro-
gram.
488 This subparagraph applies to aliens who enter the United States as refugees on or after
April 1, 1987, under § 9(c) of the Refugee Assistance Extension Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99–605, 100
Stat. 3454).
(e) 486 CASH ASSISTANCE AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO REFU-
GEES.—(1) The Director is authorized to provide assistance, reim-
bursement to States, and grants to, and contracts with, public or
private nonprofit agencies for 100 per centum of the cash assist-
ance and medical assistance provided to any refugee during the
thirty-six month period beginning with the first month in which
such refugee has entered the United States and for the identifiable
and reasonable administrative costs of providing this assistance.
(2)(A) Cash assistance provided under this subsection to an
employable refugee is conditioned, except for good cause shown—
(i) on the refugee’s registration with an appropriate agency
providing employment services described in subsection
(c)(1)(A)(i), or, if there is no such agency available, with an ap-
propriate State or local employment service;
(ii) on the refugee’s participation in any available and ap-
propriate social service or targeted assistance program (funded
under subsection (c)) providing job or language training in the

mined to be appropriate either by the agency responsible for
the initial resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) or
by the appropriate State or local employment service,
(ii) refuses to go to a job interview which has been ar-
ranged through such agency or service, or
(iii) refuses to participate in a social service or targeted as-
sistance program referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) which

priate,
cash assistance to the refugee shall be terminated (after oppor-
tunity for an administrative hearing) for a period of three months
(for the first such refusal) or for a period of six months (for any
subsequent refusal).
(3) The Director shall develop plans to provide English training
and other appropriate services and training to refugees receiving
cash assistance.
(4) If a refugee is eligible for aid or assistance under a State
program funded under part A of title IV or under title XIX of the
Social Security Act, or for supplemental security income benefits
(including State supplementary payments) under the program es-
tablished under title XVI of that Act, funds authorized under this
subsection shall only be used for the non-Federal share of such aid
or assistance, or for such supplementary payments, with respect to
cash and medical assistance provided with respect to such refugee
under this paragraph.
(5) The Director is authorized to allow for the provision of med-
ical assistance under paragraph (1) to any refugee, during the one-
year period after entry, who does not qualify for assistance under
a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act on
account of any resources or income requirement of such plan, but
only if the Director determines that—
(A) this will (i) encourage economic self-sufficiency, or (ii)
avoid a significant burden on State and local governments; and
(B) the refugee meets such alternative financial resources
and income requirements as the Director shall establish.
(6) As a condition for receiving assistance, reimbursement, or
a contract under this subsection and notwithstanding any other
provision of law, a State or agency must provide assurances that
whenever a refugee applies for cash or medical assistance for which
assistance or reimbursement is provided under this subsection, the
State or agency must notify promptly the agency (or local affiliate)
which provided for the initial resettlement of the refugee under
subsection (b) of the fact that the refugee has so applied.
(7)(A) The Secretary shall develop and implement alternative
projects for refugees who have been in the United States less than
thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim sup-
port, medical services, support services, and case management, as
needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces wel-
fare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the reset-
tlement agencies and service providers. The Secretary may permit
alternative projects to cover specific groups of refugees who have
been in the United States 36 months or longer if the Secretary de-
termines that refugees in the group have been significantly and
disproportionately dependent on welfare and need the services pro-
vided under the project in order to become self-sufficient and that
their coverage under the projects would be cost-effective.
(B) Refugees covered under such alternative projects shall be
precluded from receiving cash or medical assistance under any
other paragraph of this subsection or under title XIX or part A of
title IV of the Social Security Act.

ber 31, 1985, on the results of these projects and on any rec-
ommendations respecting changes in the refugee assistance pro-
gram under this section to take into account such results.
(D) To the extent that the use of such funds is consistent with
the purposes of such provisions, funds appropriated under section
414(a) of this Act, part A of title IV of the Social Security Act, or
title XIX of such Act, may be used for the purpose of implementing

nishing representation for any person financially unable to ob-
tain adequate representation for the district in which the hear-
ing is conducted, as provided for in section 3006A of title 18,

removal hearing, either the alien or the Department of Justice
may request the judge to issue a subpoena for the presence of
a named witness (which subpoena may also command the per-
son to whom it is directed to produce books, papers, docu-
ments, or other objects designated therein) upon a satisfactory
showing that the presence of the witness is necessary for the
determination of any material matter. Such a request may be

made ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Depart-
ment of Justice of any request for a subpoena by the alien for
a witness or material if compliance with such a subpoena
would reveal classified evidence or the source of that evidence.
The Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable oppor-
tunity to oppose the issuance of such a subpoena.
(2) PAYMENT FOR ATTENDANCE.—If an application for a
subpoena by the alien also makes a showing that the alien is
financially unable to pay for the attendance of a witness so re-
quested, the court may order the costs incurred by the process
and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid from
funds appropriated for the enforcement of title II.
(3) NATIONWIDE SERVICE.—A subpoena under this sub-
section may be served anywhere in the United States.
(4) WITNESS FEES.—A witness subpoenaed under this sub-
section shall receive the same fees and expenses as a witness
subpoenaed in connection with a civil proceeding in a court of
the United States.
(5) NO ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.—Nothing in
this subsection is intended to allow an alien to have access to
classified information.
(e) DISCOVERY.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this title—
(A) the Government is authorized to use in a removal
proceedings the fruits of electronic surveillance and
unconsented physical searches authorized under the For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801
et seq.) without regard to subsections (c), (e), (f), (g), and
(h) of section 106 of that Act and discovery of information
derived pursuant to such Act, or otherwise collected for na-
tional security purposes, shall not be authorized if disclo-
sure would present a risk to the national security of the
United States;
(B) an alien subject to removal under this title shall
not be entitled to suppress evidence that the alien alleges
was unlawfully obtained; and
(C) section 3504 of title 18, United States Code, and
section 1806(c) of title 50, United States Code, shall not
apply if the Attorney General determines that public dis-
closure would pose a risk to the national security of the
United States because it would disclose classified informa-
tion or otherwise threaten the integrity of a pending inves-
tigation.
(2) PROTECTIVE ORDERS.—Nothing in this title shall pre-
vent the United States from seeking protective orders and from
asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to
protect against the disclosure of classified information, includ-
ing the invocation of the military and State secrets privileges.
(3) TREATMENT OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.—
(A) USE.—The judge shall examine, ex parte and in
camera, any evidence for which the Attorney General de-
termines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the
national security of the United States or to the security of
any individual because it would disclose classified informa-

tion and neither the alien nor the public shall be informed
of such evidence or its sources other than through ref-
erence to the summary provided pursuant to this para-
graph. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Depart-
ment of Justice may, in its discretion and, in the case of
classified information, after coordination with the origi-
nating agency, elect to introduce such evidence in open
session.
(B) SUBMISSION.—With respect to such information,
the Government shall submit to the removal court an un-
classified summary of the specific evidence that does not
pose that risk.
(C) APPROVAL.—Not later than 15 days after submis-
sion, the judge shall approve the summary if the judge
finds that it is sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a
defense. The Government shall deliver to the alien a copy
of the unclassified summary approved under this subpara-
graph.
(D) DISAPPROVAL.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—If an unclassified summary is
not approved by the removal court under subpara-
graph (C), the Government shall be afforded 15 days
to correct the deficiencies identified by the court and
submit a revised unclassified summary.
(ii) REVISED SUMMARY.—If the revised unclassified
summary is not approved by the court within 15 days
of its submission pursuant to subparagraph (C), the
removal hearing shall be terminated unless the judge
makes the findings under clause (iii).
(iii) FINDINGS.—The findings described in this
clause are, with respect to an alien, that—
(I) the continued presence of the alien in the
United States would likely cause serious and ir-
reparable harm to the national security or death
or serious bodily injury to any person, and
(II) the provision of the summary would likely
cause serious and irreparable harm to the na-
tional security or death or serious bodily injury to
any person.
(E) CONTINUATION OF HEARING WITHOUT SUMMARY.—If
a judge makes the findings described in subparagraph
(D)(iii)—(i) if the alien involved is an alien lawfully admit-
ted for permanent residence, the procedures described
in subparagraph (F) shall apply; and
(ii) in all cases the special removal hearing shall
continue, the Department of Justice shall cause to be
delivered to the alien a statement that no summary is
possible, and the classified information submitted in
camera and ex parte may be used pursuant to this
paragraph.
(F) SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS AND CHALLENGES
TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BY SPECIAL ATTORNEYS IN
CASE OF LAWFUL PERMANENT ALIENS.—
