Subtitle D—National Commission on Dairy Policy
FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY
7 use 1446 SEC. 141. (a) Congress finds that— -
note. (1) the Federal program established to support the price of
milk marketed by producers in the United States was created to
provide price and income protection for milk producers as well
as to assure consumers of an adequate supply of milk and dairy
products at reasonable prices;
(2) the milk production industry in the United States is
composed primarily of small- and medium-sized family farm
operations;
(3) consumers in the United States benefit financially from a
. . . , , , milk price support program that prohibits large fluctuations in
V i the price and supply of milk and dairy products;
(4) consumers in the United States also benefit financiedly
from the current structure of the domestic milk production
industry; and
(5) the Office of Technology Assessment, in its report entitled
"Technology, Public Policy, and the Changing Structure of
American Agriculture", found that larger milk production oper-
ations already enjoy a major advantage in the production of
milk and that, under current Federal policy, the development
and use of new technologies will permit a continued trend
toward fewer and larger milk production operations throughout
the country.
&i ! (b) It is hereby declared to be the policy of Congress to respond to
the development of new technologies in the domestic milk produc-
tion industry by reviewing the present milk price support program
and its alternatives, and by adopting such policies as are needed to
prevent significant surplus production in the future while ensuring
that the current small- and medium-sized family farm structure of
such industry will be preserved for new generations of producers
and consumers alike.
'* ESTABUSHMENT OF COMMISSION >
7 use 1446 S E C 142. (a) There is hereby established a National Commission
note. on Daily Policy, which shall study and make recommendations
concerning the future operation of the Federal program established
to support the price of milk marketed by producers in the United
States.
(b) The Commission shall be composed of eighteen members who
are engaged in the commercial production of milk in the United
States, to be appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Not fewer
than twelve members shall be appointed from nominations submit-
ted to the Secretary by the following Members of Congress, after
consultation with the other Members of Congress who sit on the
specified committee of the respective House of Congress:
(1) The Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture of the
' ; House of Representatives.
•« (2) The ranking minority member of the Committee on Agri-
y culture of the House of Representatives.

(3) The Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,
and Forestry of the Senate.
(4) The ranking minority member of the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.

such nominations for appointment to the Commission, but not more
than two such nominations for any particular vacancy on the
Commission. The Secretary shall appoint not fewer than three
individuals from among the nominations submitted by each such
Member of Congress. Each member of the Commission shall rep-
resent a milk-producing region of the United States. A region may
be made up of more than one State and may be represented by more
than one member of the Commission. In making such appointments,
the Secretary shall take into account, to the extent practicable, the
geographical distribution of milk production volume throughout the
United States. In determining geographical representation, whole
States shall be considered as a unit.
(c) A vacancy on the Commission shall be filled in the manner in
which the original appointment was made.

study- 143. (a) The National Commission on Dairy Policy shall
(1) the current Federal price support program for milk;
(2) alternatives to such program;
(3) the future functioning of such program;
(4) new technologies that will become a part of the milk
production industry before the end of this century;
(5) the effect that developing technologies will have on sur-
plus milk production; and
(6) the future structure of the milk production industry.
In conducting such study, the Commission shall consider, among
other things, how effective the current Federal price support pro-
gram for milk will be in preventing significant surpluses of dairy
products in the future, how well such program will respond to the
challenges to the family farm structure of the milk production
industry created by developing technologies, and whether or not a
better response to those challenges could be achieved through modi-
fications or revisions of current Federal policy.
(b) On the basis of its study, the Commission shall make findings
and develop recommendations for consideration by the Secretary of
Agriculture and Congress with respect to the future operation of the
Federal price support program for milk.
(c) The Commission shall submit to the Secretary of Agriculture
and Congress, not later than March 31, 1987, a report containing the

Secretary determines that such land diversion payments are nec-
essary to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of wheat to
desirable goals. Such land diversion payments shall be made to
producers who, to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, devote to
approved conservation uses an acreage of cropland on the farm in
accordance with land diversion contracts entered into by the Sec-
retary with such producers.
"(ii) The amounts payable to producers under land diversion
contracts may be determined through the submission of bids for
such contracts by producers in such manner as the Secretary may
prescribe or through such other means as the Secretary determines
appropriate. In determining the acceptability of contract offers, the

mined by the Secretary, during the marketing years for the
immediately preceding 5 crops of corn, excluding the year in
which the average price was the highest and the year in which
the average price was the lowest in such period, except that the
loan and purchase level for a crop determined under this clause

determined for the preceding crop.
"(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if the Secretary
determines that the average price received by producers for corn in
the previous marketing year was not more than 110 percent of the
loan and purchase level for corn for such marketing year or deter-
mines that such action is necessary to maintain a competitive
market position for feed grains, the Secretary—
"(i) in the case of the 1986 crop of corn, shall reduce the loan
and purchase level for corn for the marketing year by the
amount the Secretary determines necessary to maintain domes-
tic and export markets for grain but not less than 10 percent of
the loan and purchase level for such crop; and

may reduce the loan and purchase level for corn for the market-
ing year by the amount the Secretary determines necessary to
maintain domestic and export markets for grain.

under this paragraph, without regard to the requirement imposed
under clause (ii), to producers in such area who were required to
forgo the planting of feed grains for harvest on acreage to alleviate
or eliminate the condition requiring such quarantine. If the Sec-
retary determines that such condition exists, the Secretary may
make payments under this paragraph to such producers. To be
eligible for payments under this clause, such producers may not

domestically and for export during the marketing year for such
crop.
"(D) If the Secretary determines that carryover stocks of feed
grains are excessive or an increase in stocks is needed to assure
!' desirable carryover, the Secretary may adjust the national program
acreage by the quantity the Secretary determines will accomplish
the desired increase or decrease in carryover stocks.

CROPS OF UPLAND COTTON
SEC. 501. Effective only for the 1986 through 1990 crops of upland
cotton, the Agricultural Act of 1949 is amended by inserting after
section 103 (7 U.S.C. 1444) the following new section:
"SEC. 103A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law: 7 USC 1444-1.
"(aXD Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall, on
presentation of warehouse receipts reflecting accrued storage
charges of not more than 60 days, make available for the 1986
through 1990 crops of upland cotton to producers nonrecourse loans
for a term of 10 months from the first day of the month in which the
loan is made at such level, per pound, as will reflect for Strict Low
Middling one and one-sixteenth inch upland cotton (micronaire 3.5
through 4.9) at average location in the United States at a level that
is not less than—
"(A) in the case of the 1986 crop of upland cotton, 55 cents per
pound; and
"(B) in the case of each of the 1987 through 1990 crops of
upland cotton, the smaller of—
"(i) 85 percent of the average price (weighted by market
and month) of such quality of cotton as quoted in the
* designated United States spot markets during 3 years of the
5-year period ending July 31 in the year in which the loan
level is announced, excluding the year in which the average
price was the highest and the year in which the average
price was the lowest in such period; or
"(ii) 90 percent of the average, for the 15-week period
beginning July 1 of the year in which the loan level is
announced, of the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths
quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-seconds inch
cotton C.I.F. northern Europe (adjusted downward by the
average difference during the period April 15 through Octo-
ber 15 of the year in which the loan is announced between
such average northern European price quotation of such
quality of cotton and the market quotations in the des-
ignated United States spot markets for Strict Low Middling
one and one-sixteenth inch cotton (micronaire 3.5 through
4.9)).
"(2XA) The loan level for any crop determined under paragraph
(IXB) may not be reduced by more than 5 percent from the loan level
determined for the preceding crop nor below 50 cents per pound.
"(B) If for any crop the average northern European price deter-
mined under paragraph (lXB)(ii) is less than the average United
States spot market price determined under paragraph (IXBXi), the
Secretary may increase the loan level to such level as the Secretary
may deem appropriate, not in excess of the average United States
spot market price determined under paragraph (IXBXi).
"(3) The loan level for any crop of upland cotton shall be deter- Prohibition.
mined and announced by the Secretary not later than November 1
of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which such
loan is to be effective, except that in the case of the 1986 crop, such
determination and announcement shall be made as soon as prac-
99 STAT. 1408 PUBLIC LAW 99-198—DEC. 23, 1985
ticable after the date of enactment of the Food Security Act of 1985.
Such level shall not thereafter be changed.
"(4XA) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), nonrecourse loans
provided for in this section shall, on request of the producer during
the 10th month of the loan period for the cotton, be made available
for an additional term of 8 months.
"(B) A request to extend the loan period shsdl not be approved in
any month in which the average price of Strict Low Middling one
and one-sixteenth inch cotton (micronaire 3.5 through 4.9) in the
designated spot markets for the preceding month exceeded 130
percent of the average price of such quality of cotton in such
markets for the preceding 36-month period.
"(5XA) If the S e c r e t s ^ determines that the prevailing world
market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality
and location) is below the loan level determined under the foregoing
provisions of this subsection, in order to make United States upland
cotton competitive in world markets, the Secretary shall implement
the provisions of Plan A or Plan B in accordance with this
paragraph.
"(B) If the Secretary elects to implement Plan A, the Secretary
shall permit a producer to repay a loan made for any crop at a level
determined and announced by the Secretary at the same time the
Secretary announces the loan level for such crop as determined
under paragraph (3). Such repayment level for loans on such crops
shall not be less than 80 percent of the loan level determined for the
crop. Such repajrment level, once announced for the crop, shall not
thereafter be changed.
"(CXi) If the Secretary elects to implement Plan B, except as
provided in clause (ii), the Secretary shall permit a producer to
repay a loan made for any crop at a level that is the lesser of^
"(I) the loan level determined for such crop; or
"(II) the prevailing world market price for upland cotton
(adjusted to United States quality and location), as determined
by the Secreteiry.
"(ii) For each of the 1987 through 1990 crops of cotton, if the world
market price for cotton (adjusted to United States quality and
location) as determined by the Secretary, is less than 80 percent of
the loan level determined for such crop, the Secretary may permit a
producer to repay a loan made under this subsection for a crop at
such level (not in excess of 80 percent of the loan level determined
for such crop) as the Secretary determines will—
"(I) minimize potential loan forfeitures;
"(II) minimize the accumulation of cotton stocks by the Fed-
eral Government;
"(III) minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Grovemment
in storing cotton; and
"(IV) allow cotton produced in the United States to be mar-
keted freely and competitively, both domestically and
internationally.
Exports. "(DXi) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the
period beginning August 1, 1986, and ending July 31, 1991, if a
program carried out under Plan A or Plan B fails to make United
States upland cotton fully competitive in world markets and the
prevailing world market price of upland cotton (adjusted to United
States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary, is
below the current loan repayment rate for upland cotton deter-
mined under subparagraph (A), to make United States upland

domestic consumption and exports of upland cotton produced in the
United States, the Secretary shall provide for the issuance of nego-
tiable marketing certificates in accordance with this subparagraph.
"(ii) The Commodity Credit Corporation, under such regulations
as the Secretary may prescribe, shall make payments, through the
issuance of negotiable marketing certificates, to first handlers of
cotton (persons regularly engaged in buying or selling upland
cotton) who have entered into an agreement with the Commodity
Credit Corporation to participate in the program established under
this subparagraph. Such payments shall be made in such monetary
amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary
determines will make upland cotton produced in the United States
available at competitive prices, consistent with the purposes of this
subparagraph, including such payments as may be necessary to
make raw cotton in inventory on August 1, 1986, available on the
same basis.
"(iii) The value of each certificate issued under clause (ii) shall be
based on the difference between—
"(I) the loan repayment rate for upland cotton under Plan A
or Plan B, as the case may be; and
"(II) the prevailing world market price of upland cotton, as
determined by the Secretary under a published formula sub-
mitted for public comment before its adoption.
"(iv) The Commodity Credit Corporation, under regulations pre-
scribed by the Secretary, may assist any person receiving marketing
certificates under this subparagraph in the redemption of certifi-
cates for cash, or marketing or exchange of such certificates for (I)
upland cotton owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation or (II) (if
the Secretary and the person agree) other agricultural commodities
or the products thereof owned by the Commodity Credit Corpora-
tion, at such times, in such manner, and at such price levels as the
Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the pro-
gram established under this subparagraph. Notwithstanding any
other provision of law, any price restrictions that may otherwise
apply to the disposition of agricultural commodities by the Commod-
ity Credit Corporation shall not apply to the redemption of certifi-
cates under this subparagraph.
"(v) Insofar as practicable, the Secretary shall permit owners of
certificates to designate the commodities and the products thereof,
including storage sites thereof, such owners would prefer to receive
in exchange for certificates. If any certificate is not presented for
redemption, marketing, or exchange within a reasonable number of
days after the issuance of such certificate (as determined by the
Secretary), reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges,
as determined by the Secretary, shall be deducted from the value of
the certificate for the period beginning after such reasonable
number of days and ending with the date of the presentation of such
certificate to the Commodity Credit Corporation.
"(vi) The Secretary shall take such measures as may be necessary
to prevent the marketing or exchange of agricultural commodities
and products for certificates under this section from adversely
affecting the income of producers of such commodities or products.
"(vii) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, certificates
issued to cotton handlers under this subparagraph may be trans-
ferred to other handlers and persons approved by the Secretary.

devote a portion of the permitted upland cotton acreage of the farm
(as determined in accordance with subsection (f)(2)(A)) equal to more
than 8 percent of the permitted upland cotton acreage of the farm
for the crop to conservation uses or nonprogram crops—
"(I) such portion of the permitted upland cotton acreage in

producers of upland cotton, whether or not an acreage limitation
program for upland cotton is in effect, if the Secretary determines
that such land diversion payments are necessary to assist in adjust-

be undertaken by the producers and the productivity of the acreage
diverted.

Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) and other forms of
assistance made available by the Federal Grovemment to such
producers for such losses is insufficient to alleviate such eco-
nomic emergency; and

producers to alleviate such economic emergency,
"(ii) The Secretary may make such adjustments in the amount of
payments made available under this paragraph with respect to an
individual farm so as to assure the equitable allotment of such

later than January 31 of each calendar year for the crop harvested
in that calendar year.
"(B) The Secretary may revise the national progrsim acreage first
proclaimed for any crop year for the purpose of determining the
allocation factor under paragraph (2) if the S e c r e t a ^ determines it
necessary based on the latest information. The Secretary shall
99 STAT. 1424 PUBLIC LAW 99-198—DEC. 23, 1985
proclaim such revised national program acreage as soon as it is
made.
"(C) The national program acreage for rice shall be the number of
harvested acres the Secretary determines (on the basis of the
weighted national average of the farm program payment yields for
the crop for which the determination is made) will produce the
quantity (less imports) that the Secretary estimates will be utilized
domestically and for export during the marketing year for such
crop.
"(D) If the Secretary determines that carryover stocks of rice are
excessive or an increase in stocks is needed to assure desirable
carryover, the Secretary may adjust the national program acreage
by the quantity the Secretary determines will accomplish the de-
sired increase or decrease in carryover stocks.
"(2) The Secretary shall determine a program allocation factor for
each crop of rice. The allocation factor for rice shall be determined
by dividing the national program acreage for the crop by the
number of acres that the Secretary estimates will be harvested for
such crop. In no event may the allocation factor for any crop of rice
be more than 100 percent nor less than 80 percent.
"(3)(A) The individual farm program acreage for each crop of rice
shall be determined by multiplying the allocation factor by the
acreage of rice planted for harvest on the farms for which individual
farm program acreages are required to be determined.
Prohibition. "(B) The individual farm program acreage may not be further
reduced by application of the allocation factor if the producers
reduce the acreage of rice planted for harvest on the farm from the

the percentage recommended by the Secretary in the proclamation
of the national program acreage.
"(C) The Secretary shall provide fair and equitable treatment for
producers on farms on which the acreage of rice planted for harvest
is less than the crop acreage base established for the farm under
title V, but for which the reduction is insufficient to exempt the
farm from the application of the allocation factor.
"(D) In establishing the allocation factor for rice, the Secretary
may make such adjustment as the Secretary deems necessary to
take into account the extent of exemption of farms under the
foregoing provisions of this subsection.
"(e) The farm program payment yields for farms for each crop of
rice shall be determined under title V.
"(fKlXA) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if the
Secretary determines that the total supply of rice, in the absence of
an acreage limitation program, will be excessive taking into account
the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and
stable supplies and prices and to meet a national emergency, the
Secretary may provide for any crop of rice an acreage limitation
program as described in paragraph (2).
"(B) In making a determination under clause (i), the Secretary
shall take into consideration the number of acres placed in the
conservation acreage reserve established under section 1231 of the
Post, p. 1509. Food Security Act of 1985.
"(C) If the Secretary elects to put an acreage limitation program
into effect for any crop year, the Secretary shall announce any such
program not later than January 31 of the calendar year in which
the crop is harvested.

"(D) The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable,
carry out an acreage limitation program described in paragraph (2)
for a crop of rice in a manner that will result in a carryover of 30
million hundredweight of rice.
"(2XA) If a rice acreage limitation program is announced under
pargigraph (1), such limitation shall be achieved by appljang a
uniform percentage reduction (not to exceed 35 percent) to the rice
crop acreage base for the crop for each rice-producing farm.

ineligible for rice loans, purchases, and payments with respect to
that farm.
"(C) Rice crop acreage bases for each crop of rice shall be deter-
mined under title V.
"(DXi) A number of acres on the farm shall be devoted to conserva-
tion uses, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary.
Such number shall be determined by dividing—
"(I) the product obtained by multiplying the number of acres
required to be withdrawn from the production of rice times the
number of acres planted to such commodity; by
"(II) the number of acres authorized to be planted to such
commodity under the limitation established by the Secretary.
"(ii) The number of acres determined under clause (i) is hereafter
in this subsection referred to as 'reduced acreage'.
"(E) If an acreage limitation program is announced under para-
graph (1) for a crop of rice, subsection (d) shall not be applicable to
such crop, including any prior announcement that may have been
made under such subsection with respect to such crop. Except as
provided in subsection (cXlXB), the individual farm program acreage
shall be the acreage planted on the farm to rice for harvest within
the permitted rice acreage for the farm as established under this
paragraph.

or any part of such acreage to be devoted to sweet sorghum, hay and
grazing, or the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower,
castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, flaxseed,
triticale, rye, or other commodity, if the Secretary determines that
such production is needed to provide an adequate supply of such
commodities, is not likely to increase the cost of the price support
program, and will not affect farm income adversely.
"(CXi) Except as provided in clause (ii), the Secretary shall permit,
at the request of the State committee established under section 8(b)
of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C.
590h(b)) for a State and subject to such terms and conditions as the
Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of such acreage diverted
from production by participating producers in such State to be
devoted to—

producers of rice, whether or not an acreage limitation program for
rice is in effect, if the Secretary determines that such land diversion
payments are necessary to assist in adjusting the total national
acreage of rice to desirable goals. Such land diversion payments
shall be made to producers who, to the extent prescribed by the
Secretary, devote to approved conservation uses an acreage of crop-
land on the farm in accordance with land diversion contracts en-
tered into by the Secretary with such producers.
"(B) The amounts payable to producers under land diversion
contracts may be determined through the submission of bids for
such contracts by producers in such manner as the Secretary may
prescribe or through such other means as the Secretary determines
appropriate. In determining the acceptability 6f contract offers, the
Secretary shall take into consideration the extent of the diversion to
be undertaken by the producers and the productivity of the acreage
diverted.

such amounts as the Secretary determines are equitable in relation
to the seriousness of the failure.

participating in the program under this Act for such crop who meet
the requirements of paragraph (2)) export marketing certificates,
denominated in bushels of wheat or feed grains, as applicable, for
the crop, which shall be used, under such terms and conditions as
the Secretary may prescribe consistent with the provisions of this
subsection, as follows:
"(A) Not later than 3 months before the beginning of the

I may issue to eligible producers that plant at least 50 percent of
,:^ the farm's wheat or feed grain crop acreage base for such crop,
export marketing certificates to be applicable to such marketing
year that, in the aggregate, shall equal the quantity of the
t commodity the Secretary estimates will be exported during the
marketing year. Each such eligible producer shall receive cer-
tificates for a quantity of the commodity that bears the same
" ratio to the quantity of estimated exports as the producer's crop
acreage base for that crop of the commodity bears to the
aggregate total of all such eligible producers' crop acreage bases
* for that crop, rounded upward to the nearest full bushel.

* denomination, may be exchanged by the producer, at the county
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service office, for
certificates representing an equivalent quantity of the commod-
ity in different multiples, to facilitate the operation of the
program under this subsection. Each export marketing
certificate shall designate the producer by name and the crop
involved.
"(C) If 7 months after the beginning of the marketing year for
the crop, the Secretary determines that the amount of the
-^ commodity that will be exported during the marketing year for
that crop will exceed the aggregate quantity of the commodity
'' represented by all the export marketing certificates so issued,
^ the Secretary may issue additional export marketing certifi-
cates to producers that initially received certificates for the crop
** sufficient to cover the additional exports, such certificates to be
apportioned among such producers so that producer receives the
same portion of the additional certificates issued that the pro-
ducer received of the export certificates initially issued for the
crop, as provided in subparagraph (A), rounded upward to the
-' nearest full bushel.
"(D) Producers may convey export marketing certificates
issued under this subsection to purchasers of the commodity
involved sold by the producers at any time prior to the end of

represented by the export marketing certificates issued to the
producer, because of reduced production or other reason or

because, in the case of additional certificates issued under
subparagraph (C), the producer had disposed of the producer's <
wheat or feed grains prior to the issuance of such additional
certificates, the producer, at any time prior to the end of the
marketing year for the crop involved, may sell the extra export
marketing certificates to any person for such price as agreed on
by the producer and purchaser. Any certificate may be
reconveyed without restriction.
"(2) To be eligible to receive export certificates under this subsec-

or feed grains or products thereof, from the United States during the
marketing year for the crop without surrendering to the Secretary,
at the time of export, export marketing certificates for such crop
representing the quantity of the commodity being exported or, in
the case of wheat or feed grain products, the equivalent quantity of
the commodity contained in the products being exported. Persons
that fail to comply with the requirements of the preceding sentence
shall be subject, for each violation thereof, to a fine of not more than

commodities or products owned by the Federal Government or any
agency or instrumentality thereof, nor to commodities or products
provided to the exporter by the Commodity Credit Corporation
under an export development program.

counterfeits any export marketing certificate, or with fraudulent
intent possesses, transfers, or uses any such falsely made, issued,
altered, forged, or counterfeited export marketing certificate, shall
be subject to a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not
more than 10 years, or both such fine and imprisonment.

the five crop years immediately preceding such crop year, excluding
the crop year with the highest yield per harvested acre, the crop
year with the lowest yield per harvested acre, and any crop year in
which such crop was not planted on the farm. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, the farm program payment yield for the 1983

scribed by the Secretary, may adjust any program 3deld for any
program crop for any farm if the program yield for the crop on the
farm does not accurately reflect the productive potential of the farm
because of the occurrence of a natural disaster or other similar
condition beyond the control of the producer.
"(d) In the case of any farm for which the actual yield per
harvested acre for any program crop referred to in subsection (cXD
for any crop year is not available, the county committee may assign
the farm a yield for the crop for such crop year on the basis of actual

Subtitle B—Maintenance and Development of Export Markets
TRADE POUCY DECLARATION
7 use I736p. SEC. 1121. (a) Congress finds that—
(1) the volume and value of United States agricultural exports
have significantly declined in recent years as a result of unfair
foreign competition and the high value of the dollar;
(2) this decline has been exacerbated by the lack of uniform
and coherent objectives in United States a^cultural trade
policy and the absence of direction and coordination in trade
policy formulation;
(3) agricultural interests have been under-represented in
- (5 councils of government responsible for determining economic
•' »^' policy that has contributed to a strengthening of the United
States dollar;
(4) foreign policy objectives of the United States have been
introduced into the trade policy process in a manner injurious
to the goal of msiximizing United States economic interests
through trade; and
(5) the achievement of that goal is in the best interests of the
United States.
(b) It is hereby declared to be the agricultural trade policy of the
j^,.,.. United States to—
(1) provide through all means possible agricultural commod-
ities and their products for export at competitive prices, with
full assurance of quality and reliability of supply;
(2) support the principle of free trade and the promotion of
fairer trade in agricultural commodities and their products;
(3) cooperate fully in all efforts to negotiate with foreign
countries reductions in current barriers to fair trade;
(4) counter aggressively unfair foreign trade practices using
all available means, including export restitution, export bonus
programs, and, if necessary, restrictions on United States im-
ports of foreign agricultural commodities and their products, as
a means to encourage fairer trade;
(5) remove foreign policy constraints to maximize United
States economic interests through agricultural trade; and
(6) provide for consideration of United States agricultural
trade interests in the design of national fiscal and monetary
policy that may foster continued strength in the value of the
dollar.

PUBLIC LAW 99-198—DEC. 23,1985 99 STAT. 1481
^ (1) the present high level of agricultural protectionism con-
trasts sharply with the general trade liberalization that has
been achieved since the inception of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (hereinafter referred to as "GATT"); and
(2) GATT procedures should explicitly recognize the protec-
tive effect of domestic subsidies that alter trade indirectly by
reducing the demand for imports and increasing the supply of
exports.
(b) It is the sense of Congress that the President should negotiate i K ;
with other parties to GATT to revise GATT rules and codes with the
goal of reducing agricultural export subsidies, tariffs, and nontariff
barriers to trade.

STUDY TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
SEC. 1134. (a) The Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct a study Exports.
to determine the feasibility, practicability and cost of implementing
a program to reduce the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations that is
incurred by the purchasers of United States agricultural exports
under United States export credit promotion programs. The purpose
of the study is to examine whether the GSM-102 program and all
other United States export credit initiatives relating to agricultural
exports would be enhanced by the United States assuming the
foreign exchange risk of the buyer which resulted from a rise in the
value of the United States doUar compared to the trade-weighted
index of the dollar. The index referred to is the "trade-weighted
index" published by the Department of Commerce as a measure-
ment of the relative bujdng power of the dollar compared to the
currencies of nations trading with the United States. The elements
of the program to be considered in this study would include the
following:
(1) On the datfe a foreign buyer receives GSM-102 or other Loans.
credit for purposes of purchasing United States agricultural
products, the maximum loan repayment exchange rate would
be tied to the trade-weighted value of the United States dollar
on the same date.
99 STAT. 1490 PUBLIC L A W 99-198—DEC. 23, 1985
Loans. (2) If in the future the United States dollar gains in strength
(a higher trade-weighted index), the buyer would continue to
repay the loan at the lower value fixed at the time the GSM-102
credit was extended.
(3) If the United States dollar falls in value during the term of
the repayment period, the foreign buyer could calculate his
repayment on the lower dollar value.
(b) Not later than six months after the enactment of this Act, the
Secretary shall report the results of such study to the Committee on
Agriculture of the House of Representatives and to the Committee
on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS
Defense and SEC. 1141. (a) The Congress finds and declares—
national (1) that a productive and healthy agricultural industry and a
46^USC app strong and active United States maritime industry are vitally
I24ld. important to the economic well-being and national security
objectives of our Nation;
(2) that both industries must compete in international mar-
kets increasingly dominated by foreign trade barriers and the
subsidization practices of foreign governments; and
Vessels. (3) that increased agricultural exports and the utilization of
United States merchant vessels contribute positively to the
United States balance of trade and generate employment
opportunities in the United States,
(b) It is therefore declared to be the purpose and policy of the
Congress in this subtitle—
(1) to enable the Department of Agriculture to plan its export
programs effectively, by clarifying the ocean transportation
requirements applicable to such pr(^ams;
(2) to take immediate and positive steps to promote the
growth of the cargo carrying capacity of the United States
,^ merchant marine;
(3) to expand international trade in United States agricul-
tural commodities and products and to develop, maintain, and
expand markets for United States agricultural exports;
(4) to improve the efficiency of administration of both the
commodity purchasing and selling and the ocean transportation
activities associated with export programs sponsored by the
Department of Agriculture;
f (5) to stimulate and promote both the agricultural and mari-
f time industries of the United States and encourage cooperative
efforts by both industries to address their common problems;

UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES
SEC. 1164. The Congress finds that—
(1) United States producers and processors of citrus, wheat
flour, poultry, canned fruits, and raisins have filed petitions
under section 302 of the Trade Act of 1974 alleging that the
subsidies and discriminatory tariffs of the European Commu-
nities are inconsistent with the principles and terms of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (hereafter referred to
in this section as the "GATT") and have placed United States
exporters at a competitive disadvantage;
(2) throughout the past decade, the European Communities
has repeatedly rebuffed extensive United States efforts to re-

solve these matters through bilateral consultations and multi-
lateral negotiations, as well as through consultations under the
provisions of the GATT;
(3) after many years of frustrated discussions, the United
States had no choice but to invoke the dispute settlement
procedures of the GATT as the only remaining means of seeking
redress for American producers and processors;
(4) investigatory panels, established by the GATT to review
United States complaints with respect to citrus, canned fruits,
and raisins, concluded that European Communities subsidies
and discriminatory tariffs had nullified and impaired rights of
United States exporters and were in violation of the GATT and
recommended that the European Communities take necessary
steps to rectify the matters;
(5) the European Communities has effectively and repeatedly
prevented adoption by the GATT of each of these reports, most
recently, the favorable report involving the 15-year-old citrus
complaint;
(6) on May 1, 1985, the President concluded that the GATT
dispute settlement process with respect to the citrus complaint
was terminated and, pursuant to section 301 of the Trade Act of
98 Stat. 3002, 1974, the President had to consider a subsequent course of
3003,3005. action to redress the injury to United States citrus exporters;
19 ubc 2411. (,7) Qjj jyjjg 20, 1985, the President announced that a rea-
sonable and appropriate course of action in response to the
unwillingness of the European Communities to implement the
unanimous finding of the GATT panel or to negotiate a mutu-
ally acceptable resolution of the citrus complaint is to withdraw
an equivalent amount of concessions from imported European
Communities pasta products and, in response, the European
Communities notified the United States that the European
Communities would retaliate by increasing the European
Communities duties on United States lemon and walnut
imports;
(8) on July 19, 1985, the United States and the European
Communities agreed to suspend until October 31, 1985, the
tariff increases, in order to provide the European Communities
with additional time to resolve the citrus complaint; and
Effective date. (9) despite this suspension, the European Communities has
failed to present to the United States an acceptable proposal to
resolve the citrus complaint, and effective November 1, 1985,
the United States reinstated the pasta tariff increase, and in
turn, the European Communities reinstated the lemon and
walnut tariff increase.
(b) The President shall take all appropriate and feasible action
within the power of the Presidency (including, but not limited to,
the actions described in section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19
U.S.C. 2411)) to—
(1) ensure a prompt and satisfactory resolution of all com-
plaints regarding subsidies and discriminatory tariffs of the

THAI RICE
SEC. 1165. (a) Congress finds that—
(1) Rice ranks 9th among major domestic field crops in value
of production;
(2) Rice accounts for about 5 percent of the value of major
field crops produced in the United States;
(3) The value of domestic rice production annually is over
$1,500,000,000;
(4) Ending stocks for rice have sharply increased since 1980;
(5) The projected 1985-1986 carryover of rice as a percentage
of annual use is 62 percent;
(6) Between 1980 and 1983, rice stocks rose and prices fell,
pushing rice program costs from less than one-tenth to over
nine-tenths of the value of United States rice production;
(7) Over the last several years, the percentage of world rice
exports from the United States has fallen from a high of 25
percent to 18 percent in 1985;
(8) In the last several years, Thailand has become the largest
rice exporter in the world, accounting for 30 percent of the
world market;
(9) Thai rice imports into the United States have displaced
normal sales of United States rice and have increased Govern-
ment costs;
(10) In 1983, the United States imported 33.2 million pounds
of rice from Thailand, in 1984 the United States imported 51.3
million pounds of rice (an increase of 53 percent), and in the
first six months of 1985, rice imports from Thailand to the
United States have already reached 58.3 million pounds; and
(11) A petition has been filed with the Department of Com-
merce asking that countervailing duties be imposed upon im-
ports of Thai rice into the United States.
(b) Based upon these findings, it is the sense of Congress that—
(1) our domestic rice industry is of vital importance and must
be protected from unfair foreign competition; and
(2) the Secretary of Commerce should give immediate consid-
eration to the countervailing duty petition referred to in subsec-
tion (aXll). END USERS OP IMPORTED TOBACCO
SEC. 1166. Section 213 of the Dairy and Tobacco Adjustment Act of
1983 (7 U.S.C. 511r) is amended by adding after the subsection added
by section 1161 of this Act the following:
"(fKl) The certification required under subsection (eXD of this
section shall also include the identification of any and all end users
of such tobacco of which the importer has knowledge. Any flue
cured or hurley tobacco permitted entry into the United States must
be accompanied by a written identification of any and all end users
of such tobacco. In cases in which the importer has no knowledge of
the identity of an end user, the importer shall identify any and all
purchasers to whom the importer expects to transfer such imported
tobacco. The importer shall file with the Department of Agriculture
an amended statement if, at any time after the time of entry of such
tobacco imports, the importer has knowledge of any additional

purchaser or end user. In those cases in which the importer has not
identified all end users of such imported tobacco, the Secretary of
Agriculture shall take all steps available to ascertain the identity of
any and all such end users, including requesting such information
from purchasers of such imported tobacco. Domestic purchasers of
imported tobacco shall be required to supply any relevant informa-
tion to the Department of Agriculture upon demand under this
subsection.
"(2) The Secretary shall provide to the Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and the House Committee on
Agriculture, on or before April 1, 1986, a report on the implementa-
tion of this authority to identify each end user and purchaser of
imported tobacco. Such report shall identify the end users and
purchasers of imported tobacco and the quantity, in pounds, bought
by such end user or purchaser, as well as all steps taken by the
Department of Agriculture to ascertain such identities. The Sec-
retary shall provide an additional report, beginning November 15,
1986, and annual reports thereafter, on the implementation of this
authority.
"(3) As used in this subsection, the term 'end user of imported
tobacco' means—
"(A) a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes or other tobacco
products;
"(B) an entity that mixes, blends, processes, alters in any
manner, or stores, imported tobacco for export; and
"(C) any other individual that the Secretary may identify as
making use of imported tobacco for the production of tobacco
products.".

BARTER OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES FOR STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL
MATERIAI^
SEC. 1167. (a) Congress finds that—
(1) the Commodity Credit Corporation, the General Services
Administration, and the Department of Agriculture have
authority to barter or exchange agricultural commodities for
strategic and critical materials for the national defense
stockpile;
(2) from 1950 to 1973, the Department of Agriculture con-
ducted a highly successful barter pr(^am using agricultural
commodities to acquire strategic and critical materials;
(3) private commercial firms in the United States have en-
tered into effective barter agreements with foreign governments
or private parties in foreign countries to barter or exchange
commodities and services to supplement customary commercial
transactions in international markets;
(4) barter can be an effective secondary method of reducing
excess supplies of agricultural commodities and adding needed
strategic and critical materials to the national defense stock-
pile;
(5) barter can be used to help overcome certain currency
exchange and balance-of-trade problems and to develop new
markets for United States agricultural products;
(6) barter can be used to promote United States foreign policy
interests; and
(7) several nations are potential partners in a revival of a
coherent and well-managed government barter program.

PROTECTION FOR PURCHASERS OF FARM PRODUCTS
SEC. 1324. (a) Congress finds that—

reasonable means to ensure that the seller uses the sales pro-
ceeds to repay the lender;
(2) these laws subject the purchaser of farm products to
double payment for the products, once at the time of purchase,
and again when the seller fails to repay the lender;
(3) the exposure of purchasers of farm products to double
payment inhibits free competition in the market for farm prod-
ucts; and

PROHIBITING COORDINATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT
SEC. 1325. The Secretary of Agriculture shall not use or require
the submission of the coordinated financial statement referred to in
the proposed regulations of the Farmers Home Administration pub-
lished in the Federal Register of November 8, 1983 (48 F.R. 51312-

REGULATORY RESTRAINT
SEC. 1326. (a) Congress finds and declares that—
(1) high production costs and low commodity prices have
combing to reduce farm income to the lowest levels since the
depths of the Depression in the 1930's, to subject many agricul-
tural producers, through no fault of their own, to severe eco-
nomic hardship, and in many cases temporarily but seriously to
impair producers' ability to meet loan repayment schedules in a
timely fashion; and
(2) a policy of adverse classification of agricultural loans by
bank examiners under these circumstances will trigger a wave
of foreclosures and similar actions on the part of banks, thereby

depressing land values and prices for agricultural facilities and
equipment and having a devastating effect on farmers and the
banking industry, and upon rural areas of the United States in
general,
(b) It is therefore the sense of Congress that the Federal bank
regulatory agencies should ensure, in their examination procedures,
that examiners exercise caution and restraint and give due consider-
ation not only to the current cash flow of agricultural borrowers
under flnancial stress, but to factors such as their loan collateral
and ultimate ability to repay as well, for so long as the adverse
economic effects of the cost-price squeeze of recent years continue to
impair the ability of these borrowers to meet scheduled repayments
on their loans.
STUDY OF FARM CREDIT SYSTEM
SEC. 1327. (a) The Farm Credit Administration shall conduct a
study of the need for the establishment of a fund to be used—
(1) to insure institutions of the Farm Credit System against Loans,
losses on loans made by such institutions; or
(2) for any other purp(»e that would—
(A) assist in stabilizing the financial condition of such
System; and
(B) provide for the protection of the capital that borrow- Loans,
ers of such loans have invested in such System.
(b) In conducting the study required under subsection (a), the
Farm Credit Administration shall—
(1) consider the advisability of using the revolving funds
provided for under section 4.1 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (12
U.S.C. 2152) to provide initial capital for the fund referred to in

(2) estimate the amount and level of future assessments levied
on institutions of the Farm Credit System that would be nec-
essary to ensure the long-term liquidity of such fund.

remote location of work opportunities, and unavailability of child
care.
"(iii) Any exemption of a category or individual under this
subparagraph shall be periodically evaluated to determine whether,
on the basis of the factors used to make a determination under

"(2) Not later than October 1, 1987, each State agency shall
develop and submit to the Secretary for approval a plan for the use
of an automated data processing and information retrieval system to
administer the food stamp program in such State. The State plan
shall take into consideration the model plan developed by the
Secretary under paragraph (1) and shall provide time frames for

achieve effective and cost-efficient data processing and information
systems. The Secretary, thereafter, shall periodically update such
report.
(4) Based on the Secretary's findings in such report submitted
under paragraph (3), the Secretary may require a State agency, as
necessary to rectify identified shortcomings in the administration of
the food stamp program in the State, except where such direction
would displace State initiatives already under way, to take specified
steps to automate data processing systems or computerize informa-
tion systems for the administration of the food stamp program in

automated data processing and information retrieval system submit-

State agency shall—
"(i) commence implementation of its plan not later than
October 1,1988; and
"(ii) meet the time frames set forth in the plan.
"(B) The Secretary shall extend a deadline imposed under
subparagraph (A) to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate
based on the Secretary's finding of a good faith effort of a State
agency to implement its plan in accordance with subparagraph
(A).".

GLEANING OF FIELDS
SEC. 1582. (a) Congress finds that—
(1) food banks, soup kitchens, and other emergency food
providers help needy persons seeking food assistance at no cost
to the Government;
(2) gleaning is a partnership between food producers and
nonprofit organizations through which food producers permit
members of such organizations to collect grain, vegetables, and
fruit which have not been harvested and distribute such items
to programs which provide food to needy individuals;
(3) support of gleaning to supply food to the poor is part of the
Judeo-Christian heritage as set out in the Book of Leviticus:
"When you reap the harvests of your land, do not reap to the
very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the
grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the
alien.";
(4) a 1977 General Accounting Office analysis estimated that
during the 1974 harvest 60,000,000 tons of grain, vegetables, and
fruit, valued at $5,000,000,000, were unharvested;
(5) the diets of millions of people in the United States could
have been supplemented with such lost grain, vegetables, and
fruit;
(6) a number of State and local governments have enacted
"Good Samaritan" laws which limit the liability of food donors
and provide an incentive for food contributions; and
(7) numerous civil, religious, charitable, and other nonprofit
organizations throughout the country have begun gleaning pro-
grams to harvest such food items and channel them to the
needy in the United States.
(b) It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) food producers who permit gleaning of their fields and
civic, religious, charitable, and other nonprofit organizations
which glean fields and distribute the resulting harvest to help
the needy should be commended for their efforts; and
(2) State and local governments should be encouraged to enact
tax and other incentives designed to increase the number of
food producers who permit gleaning of their fields and the
number of shippers who donate, or charge reduced rates for,
trgmsportation of gleaned produce.

farm value of $158,923,000 were produced in 1981 in the United
States;
(4) watermelons move in the channels of interstate commerce,

melons, as well as the general economic welfare of the Nation;

lish new or improved markets and uses for watermelons.

and development of alternative price support programs carried out
by the Department of Agriculture; that agricultural producers and
others have insufficient knowledge concerning the nature and
extent of price stabilization available in the private sector; and that

more information concerning the manner in which producers might
utilize agricultural commodity futures markets and options markets
in connection with their marketing of the agricultural commodities
of their own production; and to determine the nature and effect
widespread utilization of such markets by producers would have on
the prices they receive for their agricultural commodities, and to
determine the feasibility of interfacing traditional Federal price
support programs with private sector risk avoidance services.
STUDY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
7 use 1421 note. SEC. 1742. The Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct a study
utilizing the services of the various agencies of the United States,
including, but not limited to, the United States Department of
Agriculture and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to
determine the manner in which agricultural commodity futures
markets and agricultural commodity options markets might be used
by producers of agricultural commodities traded on such markets to
provide such producers with price stability and income protection;
the extent of the price stability and income protection producers
might reasonably expect to receive from such participation; and of
the Federal budgetary impact of such participation compared with
the cost of the applicable established price support programs for
agricultural commodities. The Secretary shall report the results of
such study to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry
of the Senate and to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of
Representatives on or before December 31,1988.
PILOT PROGRAM
7 use 1421 note. SEC. 1743. In connection with the study to be undertaken by the
Supra. Secretary as required by section 1742 of this subtitle, the Secretary
shall conduct a pilot program with respect to the crops of wheat,

actively produce reasonable quantities of such major agricultural
commoidities traded on the commodity futures markets and the
commodity options markets. The Secretary shall, in cooperation
with the futures and options industry and the chairman of the
commodity futures trading commission, conduct an extensive edu-
cational program for producers in the counties selected for the pilot
program. The program shall, among other things, provide that a
reasonable number of producers, as determined by the Secretary,
may at their election and in accordance with pilot program require-
ments developed by the Secretary, participate in the trading of
designated agricultural commodities on a futures market or options
market in a manner designed to protect and maximize the return on
agricultural commodities of their own production marketed by them
in accordance with program requirements. Participating producers
shall be assured by the Secretary under the terms of the program,
using funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation^ that the net
return received for the agricultural commodities that such pro-
ducers allocate to the program in the manner specified by the
Secretary is no less than the price support loan level for such
agricultural commodity in the county where it is produced. In the
formulation of the pilot program the Secretary shall utilize the
PUBLIC LAW 99-198—DEC. 23, 1985 99 STAT. 1645

more accurate than traditional animal experiments for some
purposes and further opportunities exist for the development of
these methods of testing;
(3) measures which eliminate or minimize the unnecessary
duplication of experiments on animals can result in more
productive use of Federal funds; and
