(B) Exception.—Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize an undefinitized contractual action before an amount that exceeds 50 percent of the negotiated overall ceiling price is obligated on such action, the contracting officer for such action may not obligate with respect to such contractual action an amount that exceeds 75 percent of the negotiated overall ceiling price until the contractual terms, specifications, and price are definitized for such contractual action.

(3) Waiver.—The Commandant may waive the application of this subsection with respect to a contract if the Commandant determines that the waiver is necessary to support—

(A) a contingency operation (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(13) of title 10);

(2) establishes the feasibility of alternatives;

(3) develops an acquisition project or program baseline;

(4) produces a life-cycle cost estimate; and

(5) assesses the relative merits of alternatives to determine a preferred solution in accordance with the requirements of this section.

(b) Submission Required Before Proceeding.—Any Coast Guard Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program may not begin to obtain any capability or asset or proceed beyond that phase of its development that entails approving the supporting acquisition until the Commandant submits to the appropriate congressional committees the following:

(1) The key performance parameters, the key system attributes, and the operational performance attributes of the capability or asset to be acquired under the proposed acquisition project or program.

(2) Test and evaluation strategy.—The master plan shall—

(A) set forth an integrated test and evaluation strategy that will verify that capability-level or asset-level and subsystem-level design and development, including performance and supportability, have been sufficiently proven before the capability, asset, or subsystem of the capability or asset is approved for production; and

(B) require that adequate developmental tests and evaluations and operational tests and evaluations established under subparagraph (A) are performed to inform production decisions.

(3) Other components of the master plan.—At a minimum, the master plan shall identify—

(A) the key performance parameters to be resolved through the integrated test and evaluation strategy;

(B) the performance data to be used to determine whether the key performance parameters have been resolved;

(A) proceed beyond that phase of the acquisition process that entails approving the supporting acquisition of a capability or asset before the master plan is approved by the Chief Acquisition Officer; or

(B) award any production contract for a capability, asset, or subsystem for which a master plan is required under this subsection before the master plan is approved by the Chief Acquisition Officer.

(e) Life-Cycle Cost Estimates.—

(1) In general.—The Commandant shall implement mechanisms to ensure the development and regular updating of life-cycle cost estimates for each acquisition with a total acquisition cost that equals or exceeds $10,000,000 and an expected service life of 10 or more years, and to ensure that these estimates are considered in decisions to develop or produce new or enhanced capabilities and assets.

(2) Types of estimates.—For each Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program, in addition to life-cycle cost estimates developed under paragraph (1), the Commandant shall require that—

(A) life-cycle cost estimates developed under paragraph (1) be updated before—
