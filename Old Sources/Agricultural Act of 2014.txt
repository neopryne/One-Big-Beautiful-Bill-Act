of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 is not avail-
able, the Secretary shall use such information as the Sec-
retary determines to be fair and equitable to establish a
national average yield under this section.
(3) USE OF COUNTY AVERAGE YIELD.—If the yield per plant-
ed acre for a crop of an oilseed designated before the date of
enactment of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 for a
farm for any of the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less
than 75 percent of the county yield for that designated oilseed,
the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to
75 percent of the county yield for the purpose of determining
the average under paragraph (1).
(4) TREATMENT OF OILSEEDS DESIGNATED AFTER CERTAIN
DATE.—In the case of oilseeds designated on or after the date
of enactment of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, the
payment yield shall be equal to 90 percent of the average of
the yield per planted acre for the most recent 5 crop years, as
determined by the Secretary, excluding any crop year in which
the acreage planted to the covered commodity was zero.
(c) EFFECT OF LACK OF PAYMENT YIELD.—
(1) ESTABLISHMENT BY SECRETARY.—In the case of a cov-
ered commodity on a farm for which base acres have been es-
tablished or that is planted on generic base acres, if no pay-
ment yield is otherwise established for the covered commodity
on the farm, the Secretary shall establish an appropriate pay-
ment yield for the covered commodity on the farm under para-
graph (2).
(2) USE OF SIMILARLY SITUATED FARMS.—To establish an
appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on a farm
as required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into con-
sideration the farm program payment yields applicable to that
covered commodity for similarly situated farms. The use of
such data in an appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer,
shall not be subject to any other provision of law.
(d) SINGLE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE YIELDS.—
(1) ELECTION TO UPDATE.—At the sole discretion of the
owner of a farm, the owner of a farm shall have a 1-time op-
portunity to update, on a covered-commodity-by-covered-com-
modity basis, the payment yield that would otherwise be used
in calculating any price loss coverage payment for each covered
commodity on the farm for which the election is made.

(2) METHOD OF UPDATING YIELDS FOR COVERED COMMOD-
ITIES.—If the owner of a farm elects to update yields under
paragraph (1), the payment yield for a covered commodity on
the farm, for the purpose of calculating price loss coverage pay-
ments only, shall be equal to the product obtained by multi-
plying—
(A) 90 percent;
(B) the average of the yield per planted acre for the
crop of covered commodities on the farm for the 2013
through 2017 crop years, as determined by the Secretary,
excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to
the covered commodity was zero; and
(C) subject to paragraph (3), the ratio obtained by di-
viding—
(i) the average of the 2008 through 2012 national
average yield per planted acre for the covered com-
modity, as determined by the Secretary; by
(ii) the average of the 2013 through 2017 national
average yield per planted acre for the covered com-
modity, as determined by the Secretary.
(3) LIMITATION.—In no case shall the ratio obtained under
paragraph (2)(C) be less than 90 percent or greater than 100
percent.
(4) USE OF COUNTY AVERAGE YIELD.—For the purposes of
determining the average yield per planted acre under para-
graph (2)(B), if the yield per planted acre for a crop of a cov-
ered commodity for a farm for any of the crop years described
in that subparagraph was less than 75 percent of the average
of county yields for those crop years for that commodity, the
Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75
percent of the average of the 2013 through 2017 county yield
for the covered commodity.
(5) UPLAND COTTON CONVERSION.—In the case of seed cot-
ton, for purposes of determining the average of the yield per
planted acre under this subsection, the average yield for seed
cotton per planted acre shall be equal to 2.4 times the average
yield for upland cotton per planted acre.
(6) TIME FOR ELECTION.—An election under this subsection
shall be made at a time and manner so as to be in effect begin-
ning with the 2020 crop year, as determined by the Secretary.
(e) PAYMENT YIELD FOR SEED COTTON.—
(1) PAYMENT YIELD.—Subject to paragraph (2), the pay-
ment yield for seed cotton for a farm shall be equal to 2.4
times the payment yield for upland cotton for the farm estab-
lished under section 1104(e)(3) of the Food, Conservation, and
Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8714(e)(3)) (as in effect on Sep-
tember 30, 2013).
(2) UPDATE.—At the sole discretion of the owner of a farm
with a yield for upland cotton described in paragraph (1), the
owner of the farm shall have a 1-time opportunity to update
the payment yield for upland cotton for the farm, as provided
in subsection (d), for the purpose of calculating the payment
yield for seed cotton under paragraph (1).

SEC. 1114. ø7 U.S.C. 9014¿ PAYMENT ACRES.
(a) DETERMINATION OF PAYMENT ACRES.—
(1) GENERAL RULE.—For the purpose of price loss coverage
and agriculture risk coverage when county coverage has been
selected under section 1115(b)(1), but subject to subsection (e),
the payment acres for each covered commodity on a farm shall
be equal to 85 percent of the base acres for the covered com-
modity on the farm.
(2) EFFECT OF INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE.—In the case of agri-
culture risk coverage when individual coverage has been se-
lected under section 1115(b)(2), but subject to subsection (e),
the payment acres for a farm shall be equal to 65 percent of
the base acres for all of the covered commodities on the farm.
(b) TREATMENT OF GENERIC BASE ACRES.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—In the case of generic base acres, price
loss coverage payments and agriculture risk coverage pay-
ments are made only with respect to generic base acres planted
to a covered commodity for the crop year.
(2) ATTRIBUTION.—With respect to a farm containing ge-
neric base acres, for the purpose of applying paragraphs (1)
and (2) of subsection (a), generic base acres on the farm are at-
tributed to a covered commodity in the following manner:
(A) If a single covered commodity is planted and the
total acreage planted exceeds the generic base acres on the
farm, the generic base acres are attributed to that covered
commodity in an amount equal to the total number of ge-
neric base acres.
(B) If multiple covered commodities are planted and
the total number of acres planted to all covered commod-
ities on the farm exceeds the generic base acres on the
farm, the generic base acres are attributed to each of the
covered commodities on the farm on a pro rata basis to re-
flect the ratio of—
(i) the acreage planted to a covered commodity on
the farm; to
(ii) the total acreage planted to all covered com-
modities on the farm.
(C) If the total number of acres planted to all covered
commodities on the farm does not exceed the generic base
acres on the farm, the number of acres planted to a cov-
ered commodity is attributed to that covered commodity.
(3) TREATED AS ADDITIONAL ACREAGE.—When generic base
acres are planted to a covered commodity or acreage planted
to a covered commodity is attributed to generic base acres, the
generic base acres are in addition to other base acres on the
farm.
(4) SEED COTTON.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary shall
require the owner of a farm to allocate all generic base
acres on the farm under subparagraph (B) or (C), or both.
(B) NO RECENT HISTORY OF COVERED COMMODITIES.—
In the case of a farm on which no covered commodities (in-
cluding seed cotton) were planted or were prevented from
December 20, 2018

Q:\COMP\113-2\Agricultural Act of 2014.xml
Agricultural Act of 2014
being planted at any time during the 2009 through 2016
crop years, the owner of such farm shall allocate generic
base acres on the farm to unassigned crop base for which
no payments may be made under section 1116 or 1117.
(C) RECENT HISTORY OF COVERED COMMODITIES.—In
the case of a farm not described in subparagraph (B), the
owner of such farm shall allocate generic base acres on the
farm—
(i) subject to subparagraph (D), to seed cotton base
acres in a quantity equal to the greater of—
(I) 80 percent of the generic base acres on the
farm; or
(II) the average number of seed cotton acres
planted or prevented from being planted on the
farm during the 2009 through 2012 crop years
(not to exceed the total generic base acres on the
farm); or
(ii) to base acres for covered commodities (includ-
ing seed cotton), by applying subparagraphs (B), (D),
(E), and (F) of section 1112(a)(3).
(D) TREATMENT OF RESIDUAL GENERIC BASE ACRES.—In
the case of a farm on which generic base acres are allo-
cated under subparagraph (C)(i), the residual generic base
acres shall be allocated to unassigned crop base for which
no payments may be made under section 1116 or 1117.
(E) EFFECT OF FAILURE TO ALLOCATE.—In the case of
a farm not described in subparagraph (B) for which the
owner of the farm fails to make an election under subpara-
graph (C), the owner of the farm shall be deemed to have
elected to allocate all generic base acres in accordance with
subparagraph (C)(i).
(c) EXCLUSION.—The quantity of payment acres determined
under subsection (a) may not include any crop subsequently plant-
ed during the same crop year on the same land for which the first
crop is eligible for price loss coverage payments or agriculture risk
coverage payments, unless the crop was approved for double crop-
ping in the county, as determined by the Secretary.
(d) EFFECT OF MINIMAL PAYMENT ACRES.—
(1) PROHIBITION ON PAYMENTS.—Notwithstanding any
other provision of this title, a producer on a farm may not re-
ceive price loss coverage payments or agriculture risk coverage
payments if the sum of the base acres on the farm is 10 acres
or less, as determined by the Secretary, unless the sum of the
base acres on the farm, when combined with the base acres of
other farms in which the producer has an interest, is more
than 10 acres.
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—Paragraph (1) does not apply to a pro-
ducer that is—
(A) a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher (as de-
fined in section 355(e) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural
Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2003(e)));
(B) a limited resource farmer or rancher, as defined by
the Secretary;

case of price loss coverage payments and agricultural risk cov-
erage payments using county coverage, the reduction under
paragraph (1) shall be the amount equal to the base acres
planted to crops referred to in such paragraph in excess of 15
percent of base acres.
(3) INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE.—In the case of agricultural risk
coverage payments using individual coverage, the reduction
under paragraph (1) shall be the amount equal to the base
acres planted to crops referred to in such paragraph in excess
of 35 percent of base acres.

acres shall be made under this subsection if—
(A) cover crops or crops referred to in paragraph (1)
are grown solely for conservation purposes and not har-
vested for use or sale, as determined by the Secretary; or
(B) in any region in which there is a history of double-
cropping covered commodities with crops referred to in
paragraph (1) and such crops were so double-cropped on
the base acres, as determined by the Secretary.
(5) EFFECT OF REDUCTION.—For each crop year for which
fruits, vegetables (other than mung beans and pulse crops), or
wild rice are planted to base acres on a farm for which a reduc-
tion in payment acres is made under this subsection, the Sec-
retary shall consider such base acres to be planted, or pre-
vented from being planted, to a covered commodity for pur-
poses of any adjustment or reduction of base acres for the farm
under section 1112.
(f) UNASSIGNED CROP BASE.—The Secretary shall maintain in-
formation on generic base acres on a farm allocated as unassigned
crop base under subsection (b)(4).

‘‘(vi) STANDARDS.
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL. Employment and training ac-
tivities under this subparagraph shall be consid-

difference, if any, between supplemental nu-
trition assistance and other public benefit re-
ceipt expenditures, employment, earnings and
other impacts as determined by the Sec-
retary— ‘‘(AA) as a result of the employment
