vide such commodities to persons served by the eligible recipient

take such precautions as the Secretary deems necessary to assure
that commodities made available under this Act will not displace
commercial sales of such commodities or the products thereof. The
Secretary shall not make commodities available for donation in any
quantity or manner that the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discre-
tion, determines may, substitute for the same or any other agricul-
tural produce that would otherwise be purchased in the market.

AUTHORIZATION AND APPROPRIATIONS
SEC. 204. ø7 U.S.C. 7508¿ (a)(1) There are authorized to be ap-
propriated $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year
thereafter, for the Secretary to make available to the States to pay
for the direct and indirect costs of the States related to the proc-
essing, storage, transporting, and distributing to eligible recipient
agencies of commodities provided by the Secretary under this Act
and commodities secured from other sources, including commodities
secured by gleaning (as defined in section 111(a) of the Hunger
Prevention Act of 1988 (7 U.S.C. 612c note; Public Law 100–435))
and donated wild game. Funds appropriated under this paragraph
for any fiscal year shall be allocated to the States on an advance
basis, dividing such funds among the States in the same propor-
tions as the commodities distributed under this Act for such fiscal
year are divided among the States. If a State agency is unable to
use all of the funds so allocated to it, the Secretary shall reallocate
such unused funds among the other States.
(2) Each State shall make available to emergency feeding orga-
nizations in the State not less than 40 per centum of the funds pro-
vided as authorized in paragraph (1) that it has been allocated for
a fiscal year, as necessary to pay for, or provide advance payments
to cover, the direct expenses of the emergency feeding organiza-
tions for distributing commodities to needy persons, but only to the
extent such expenses are actually so incurred by such organiza-
tions. As used in this paragraph, the term ‘‘direct expenses’’ in-
cludes costs of transporting, storing, handling, repackaging, proc-
essing, and distributing commodities incurred after they are re-
ceived by the organization; costs associated with determinations of
eligibility, verification, and documentation; costs of providing infor-
mation to persons receiving commodities under this Act concerning
the appropriate storage and preparation of such commodities; and
costs of recordkeeping, auditing, and other administrative proce-
dures required for participation in the program under this Act. If
a State makes a payment, using State funds, to cover direct ex-
penses of emergency feeding organizations, the amount of such
payment shall be counted toward the amount a State must make
available for direct expenses of emergency feeding organizations
under this paragraph.
(3) States to which funds are allocated for a fiscal year under
this subsection shall submit financial reports to the Secretary, on
a regular basis, as to the use of such funds. No such funds may
be used by States or emergency feeding organizations for costs
other than those involved in covering the expenses related to the
distribution of commodities by emergency feeding organizations.
(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), effective Janu-
ary 1, 1987, to be eligible to receive funds under this subsection,
a State shall provide in cash or in kind (according to procedures
approved by the Secretary for certifying these in-kind contribu-

retary shall allot—
(1) 60 percent of the total value of additional commodities
provided to States in a manner such that the value of addi-
tional commodities allocated to each State bears the same ratio
to 60 percent of the total value of additional commodities as
the number of persons in households within the State having
incomes below the poverty line bears to the total number of
persons in households within all States having incomes below
such poverty line, and each State shall be entitled to receive
such value of additional commodities; and
(2) 40 percent of the total value of additional commodities
provided to States in a manner such that the value of addi-
tional commodities allocated to each State bears the same ratio
to 40 percent of the total value of additional commodities as
the average monthly number of unemployed persons within the
State bears to the average monthly number of unemployed per-
sons within all States during the same fiscal year, and each
State shall be entitled to receive such value of additional com-
modities.
(b) REALLOCATION.—The Secretary shall notify each State of
the amount of the additional commodities that such State is allot-
ted to receive under subsection (a), and each State shall promptly
notify the Secretary if such State determines that it will not accept
any or all of the commodities made available under such allocation.
On such a notification by a State, the Secretary shall reallocate
and distribute the amount the State was allocated to receive under
the formula prescribed in subsection (a) but declines to accept. The
Secretary shall further establish procedures to permit States to de-
cline to receive portions of such allocation during each fiscal year
as the State determines is appropriate and the Secretary shall re-
allocate and distribute such allocation. In the event of any drought,
flood, hurricane, or other natural disaster affecting substantial
numbers of persons in a State, county, or parish, the Secretary may
request that States unaffected by such a disaster consider assisting
affected States by allowing the Secretary to reallocate commodities
to which each such unaffected State is entitled to States containing
areas adversely affected by the disaster.

cal year under this section shall be delivered at reasonable in-
