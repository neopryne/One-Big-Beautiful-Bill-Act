TITLE I—AIR POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL
PART A—AIR QUALITY AND EMISSION LIMITATIONS
FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
SEC. 101. (a) The Congress finds—
(1) that the predominant part of the Nation’s population is
located in its rapidly expanding metropolitan and other urban
areas, which generally cross the boundary lines of local juris-
dictions and often extend into two or more States;
(2) that the growth in the amount and complexity of air
pollution brought about by urbanization, industrial develop-
ment, and the increasing use of motor vehicles, has resulted in
mounting dangers to the public health and welfare, including
injury to agricultural crops and livestock, damage to and the
deterioration of property, and hazards to air and ground trans-
portation;
(3) that air pollution prevention (that is, the reduction or
elimination, through any measures, of the amount of pollutants
produced or created at the source) and air pollution control at
its source is the primary responsibility of States and local gov-
ernments; and
(4) that Federal financial assistance and leadership is es-
sential for the development of cooperative Federal, State, re-
gional, and local programs to prevent and control air pollution.
(b) The purposes of this title are—
(1) to protect and enhance the quality of the Nation’s air
resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and
the productive capacity of its population;
(2) to initiate and accelerate a national research and devel-
opment program to achieve the prevention and control of air
pollution;
(3) to provide technical and financial assistance to State
and local governments in connection with the development and
execution of their air pollution prevention and control pro-
grams; and
(4) to encourage and assist the development and operation
of regional air pollution prevention and control programs.
(c) POLLUTION PREVENTION.—A primary goal of this Act is to
encourage or otherwise promote reasonable Federal, State, and
local governmental actions, consistent with the provisions of this
Act, for pollution prevention.

and, so far as practicable in the light of varying conditions and
needs, uniform State and local laws relating to the prevention and
control of air pollution; and encourage the making of agreements
and compacts between States for the prevention and control of air
pollution.
(b) The Administrator shall cooperate with and encourage coop-
erative activities by all Federal departments and agencies having
functions relating to the prevention and control of air pollution, so
as to assure the utilization in the Federal air pollution control pro-
gram of all appropriate and available facilities and resources with-
in the Federal Government.
(c) The consent of the Congress is hereby given to two or more
States to negotiate and enter into agreements or compacts, not in
conflict with any law or treaty of the United States, for (1) coopera-
tive effort and mutual assistance for the prevention and control of
air pollution and the enforcement of their respective laws relating
thereto, and (2) the establishment of such agencies, joint or other-
wise, as they may deem desirable for making effective such agree-
ments or compacts. No such agreement or compact shall be binding
or obligatory upon any State a party thereto unless and until it has
been approved by Congress. It is the intent of Congress that no
agreement or compact entered into between States after the date
of enactment of the Air Quality Act of 1967, which relates to the
control and abatement of air pollution in an air quality control re-
gion, shall provide for participation by a State which is not in-
cluded (in whole or in part) in such air quality control region.

imum shall have 3 years following the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in which to contribute such
amount. If such an agency fails to meet and maintain this required
level, the Administrator shall reduce the amount of the Federal
contribution accordingly.
(C) With respect to any air quality control region or portion
thereof for which there is an applicable implementation plan under
section 110, grants under subparagraph (A) may be made only to
air pollution control agencies which have substantial responsibil-
ities for carrying out such applicable implementation plan.
(2) Before approving any grant under this subsection to any air
pollution control agency within the meaning of sections 302(b)(2)
and 302(b)(4) the Administrator shall receive assurances that such
agency provides for adequate representation of appropriate State,
interstate, local, and (when appropriate) international, interests in
the air quality control region.

(3) Before approving any planning grant under this subsection
to any air pollution control agency within the meaning of sections
302(b)(2) and 302(b)(4), the Administrator shall receive assurances
that such agency has the capability of developing a comprehensive
air quality plan for the air quality control region, which plan shall
include (when appropriate) a recommended system of alerts to
avert and reduce the risk of situations in which there may be im-
minent and serious danger to the public health or welfare from air
pollutants and the various aspects relevant to the establishment of
air quality standards for such air quality control region, including
the concentration of industries, other commercial establishments,
population and naturally occurring factors which shall affect such
standards.
(b)(1) From the sums available for the purposes of subsection
(a) of this section for any fiscal year, the Administrator shall from
time to time make grants to air pollution control agencies upon
such terms and conditions as the Administrator may find necessary
to carry out the purpose of this section. In establishing regulations
for the granting of such funds the Administrator shall, so far as
practicable, give due consideration to (A) the population, (B) the ex-
tent of the actual or potential air pollution problem, and (C) the fi-
nancial need of the respective agencies.
(2) Not more than 10 per centum of the total of funds appro-
priated or allocated for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section
shall be granted for air pollution control programs in any one
State. In the case of a grant for a program in an area crossing
State boundaries, the Administrator shall determine the portion of
such grant that is chargeable to the percentage limitation under
this subsection for each State into which such area extends. Sub-
ject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, no State
shall have made available to it for application less than one-half
of 1 per centum of the annual appropriation for grants under this
section for grants to agencies within such State.
(c) MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.—(1) No agency shall receive any
grant under this section during any fiscal year when its expendi-
tures of non-Federal funds for recurrent expenditures for air pollu-
tion control programs will be less than its expenditures were for
such programs during the preceding fiscal year. In order for the
Administrator to award grants under this section in a timely man-
ner each fiscal year, the Administrator shall compare an agency’s
prospective expenditure level to that of its second preceding fiscal
year. The Administrator shall revise the current regulations which
define applicable nonrecurrent and recurrent expenditures, and in
so doing, give due consideration to exempting an agency from the
limitations of this paragraph and subsection (a) due to periodic in-
creases experienced by that agency from time to time in its annual
expenditures for purposes acceptable to the Administrator for that
fiscal year.
(2) The Administrator may still award a grant to an agency not
meeting the requirements of paragraph (l) 7 of this subsection if the
Administrator, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, de-
termines that a reduction in expenditures is attributable to a non-

ent by the amount of the pay, allowances, traveling expenses, and
any other costs in connection with the detail of any officer or em-
ployee to the recipient under section 301 of the Act, when such de-
tail is for the convenience of, and at the request of, such recipient

AIR QUALITY CONTROL REGIONS
SEC. 107. (a) Each State shall have the primary responsibility
for assuring air quality within the entire geographic area com-
prising such State by submitting an implementation plan for such
State which will specify the manner in which national primary and
secondary ambient air quality standards will be achieved and
maintained within each air quality control region in such State.
(b) For purposes of developing and carrying out implementa-
tion plans under section 110—
(1) an air quality control region designated under this sec-
tion before the date of enactment of the Clean Air Amend-
ments of 1970, or a region designated after such date under
subsection (c), shall be an air quality control region; and
(2) the portion of such State which is not part of any such
designated region shall be an air quality control region, but
such portion may be subdivided by the State into two or more
air quality control regions with the approval of the Adminis-
trator.
(c) The Administrator shall, within 90 days after the date of
enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, after consultation
with appropriate State and local authorities, designate as an air
quality control region any interstate area or major intrastate area
which he deems necessary or appropriate for the attainment and
maintenance of ambient air quality standards. The Administrator
shall immediately notify the Governors of the affected States of any
designation made under this subsection.
(d) DESIGNATIONS.—
(1) DESIGNATIONS GENERALLY.—
(A) SUBMISSION BY GOVERNORS OF INITIAL DESIGNA-
TIONS FOLLOWING PROMULGATION OF NEW OR REVISED
STANDARDS.—By such date as the Administrator may rea-
sonably require, but not later than 1 year after promulga-
tion of a new or revised national ambient air quality
standard for any pollutant under section 109, the Governor
of each State shall (and at any other time the Governor of
a State deems appropriate the Governor may) submit to
the Administrator a list of all areas (or portions thereof)
in the State, designating as—
(i) nonattainment, any area that does not meet (or
that contributes to ambient air quality in a nearby
area that does not meet) the national primary or sec-
ondary ambient air quality standard for the pollutant,
(ii) attainment, any area (other than an area iden-
tified in clause (i)) that meets the national primary or
secondary ambient air quality standard for the pollut-
ant, or
(iii) unclassifiable, any area that cannot be classi-
fied on the basis of available information as meeting

or not meeting the national primary or secondary am-
bient air quality standard for the pollutant.
The Administrator may not require the Governor to sub-
mit the required list sooner than 120 days after promul-
gating a new or revised national ambient air quality
standard.
(B) PROMULGATION BY EPA OF DESIGNATIONS.—(i) Upon
promulgation or revision of a national ambient air quality
standard, the Administrator shall promulgate the designa-
tions of all areas (or portions thereof) submitted under
subparagraph (A) as expeditiously as practicable, but in no
case later than 2 years from the date of promulgation of
the new or revised national ambient air quality standard.
Such period may be extended for up to one year in the
event the Administrator has insufficient information to
promulgate the designations.
(ii) In making the promulgations required under
clause (i), the Administrator may make such modifications
as the Administrator deems necessary to the designations
of the areas (or portions thereof) submitted under subpara-
graph (A) (including to the boundaries of such areas or
portions thereof). Whenever the Administrator intends to
make a modification, the Administrator shall notify the
State and provide such State with an opportunity to dem-
onstrate why any proposed modification is inappropriate.
The Administrator shall give such notification no later
than 120 days before the date the Administrator promul-
gates the designation, including any modification thereto.
If the Governor fails to submit the list in whole or in part,
as required under subparagraph (A), the Administrator
shall promulgate the designation that the Administrator
deems appropriate for any area (or portion thereof) not
designated by the State.
(iii) If the Governor of any State, on the Governor’s
own motion, under subparagraph (A), submits a list of
areas (or portions thereof) in the State designated as non-
attainment, attainment, or unclassifiable, the Adminis-
trator shall act on such designations in accordance with
the procedures under paragraph (3) (relating to redesigna-
tion).
(iv) A designation for an area (or portion thereof)
made pursuant to this subsection shall remain in effect
until the area (or portion thereof) is redesignated pursuant
to paragraph (3) or (4).
(C) DESIGNATIONS BY OPERATION OF LAW.—(i) Any area
designated with respect to any air pollutant under the pro-
visions of paragraph (1) (A), (B), or (C) of this subsection
(as in effect immediately before the date of the enactment

law, as an attainment area for such pollutant within the
meaning of subparagraph (A)(ii).
(iii) Any area designated with respect to any air pol-
lutant under the provisions of paragraph (1)(D) (as in ef-
fect immediately before the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) is designated, by oper-
ation of law, as an unclassifiable area for such pollutant
within the meaning of subparagraph (A)(iii).
(2) PUBLICATION OF DESIGNATIONS AND REDESIGNATIONS.—
(A) The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal
Register promulgating any designation under paragraph (1) or
(5), or announcing any designation under paragraph (4), or pro-
mulgating any redesignation under paragraph (3).
(B) Promulgation or announcement of a designation under
paragraph (1), (4) or (5) shall not be subject to the provisions
of sections 553 through 557 of title 5 of the United States Code
(relating to notice and comment), except nothing herein shall
be construed as precluding such public notice and comment
whenever possible.
(3) REDESIGNATION.—(A) Subject to the requirements of
subparagraph (E), and on the basis of air quality data, plan-
ning and control considerations, or any other air quality-re-
lated considerations the Administrator deems appropriate, the
Administrator may at any time notify the Governor of any
State that available information indicates that the designation
of any area or portion of an area within the State or interstate
area should be revised. In issuing such notification, which shall
be public, to the Governor, the Administrator shall provide
such information as the Administrator may have available ex-
plaining the basis for the notice.
(B) No later than 120 days after receiving a notification
under subparagraph (A), the Governor shall submit to the Ad-
ministrator such redesignation, if any, of the appropriate area
(or areas) or portion thereof within the State or interstate area,
as the Governor considers appropriate.
(C) No later than 120 days after the date described in sub-
paragraph (B) (or paragraph (1)(B)(iii)), the Administrator
shall promulgate the redesignation, if any, of the area or por-
tion thereof, submitted by the Governor in accordance with
subparagraph (B), making such modifications as the Adminis-
trator may deem necessary, in the same manner and under the
same procedure as is applicable under clause (ii) of paragraph
(1)(B), except that the phrase ‘‘60 days’’ shall be substituted for
the phrase ‘‘120 days’’ in that clause. If the Governor does not
submit, in accordance with subparagraph (B), a redesignation
for an area (or portion thereof) identified by the Administrator
under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall promulgate
such redesignation, if any, that the Administrator deems ap-
propriate.
(D) The Governor of any State may, on the Governor’s own
motion, submit to the Administrator a revised designation of
any area or portion thereof within the State. Within 18 months
of receipt of a complete State redesignation submittal, the Ad-

ministrator shall approve or deny such redesignation. The sub-
mission of a redesignation by a Governor shall not affect the
effectiveness or enforceability of the applicable implementation
plan for the State.
(E) The Administrator may not promulgate a redesignation
of a nonattainment area (or portion thereof) to attainment un-
less— (i) the Administrator determines that the area has at-
tained the national ambient air quality standard;
(ii) the Administrator has fully approved the applica-
ble implementation plan for the area under section 110(k);
(iii) the Administrator determines that the improve-
ment in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable
reductions in emissions resulting from implementation of
the applicable implementation plan and applicable Federal
air pollutant control regulations and other permanent and
enforceable reductions;
(iv) the Administrator has fully approved a mainte-
nance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of
section 175A; and
(v) the State containing such area has met all require-
ments applicable to the area under section 110 and part D.
(F) The Administrator shall not promulgate any redesigna-
tion of any area (or portion thereof) from nonattainment to
unclassifiable.
(4) NONATTAINMENT DESIGNATIONS FOR OZONE, CARBON
MONOXIDE AND PARTICULATE MATTER (PM–10).—
(A) OZONE AND CARBON MONOXIDE.—(i) Within 120
days after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, each Governor of each State shall
submit to the Administrator a list that designates, affirms
or reaffirms the designation of, or redesignates (as the case
may be), all areas (or portions thereof) of the Governor’s
State as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable with
respect to the national ambient air quality standards for
ozone and carbon monoxide.
(ii) No later than 120 days after the date the Governor
is required to submit the list of areas (or portions thereof)
required under clause (i) of this subparagraph, the Admin-
istrator shall promulgate such designations, making such
modifications as the Administrator may deem necessary,
in the same manner, and under the same procedure, as is
applicable under clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(B), except that
the phrase ‘‘60 days’’ shall be substituted for the phrase
‘‘120 days’’ in that clause. If the Governor does not submit,
in accordance with clause (i) of this subparagraph, a des-
ignation for an area (or portion thereof), the Administrator
shall promulgate the designation that the Administrator
deems appropriate.
(iii) No nonattainment area may be redesignated as an
attainment area under this subparagraph.

the Bureau of the Census) is classified under part D of this
title as a Serious, Severe, or Extreme Area, the boundaries
of such area are hereby revised (on the date 45 days after
such classification) by operation of law to include the en-
tire metropolitan statistical area or consolidated metropoli-
tan statistical area, as the case may be, unless within such
45-day period the Governor (in consultation with State and
local air pollution control agencies) notifies the Adminis-
trator that additional time is necessary to evaluate the ap-
plication of clause (v). Whenever a Governor has submitted
such a notice to the Administrator, such boundary revision
shall occur on the later of the date 8 months after such
classification or 14 months after the date of the enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 unless the Gov-
ernor makes the finding referred to in clause (v), and the
Administrator concurs in such finding, within such period.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a bound-
ary revision under this clause or clause (v) shall apply for
purposes of any State implementation plan revision re-
quired to be submitted after the date of the enactment of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
(v) Whenever the Governor of a State has submitted
a notice under clause (iv), the Governor, in consultation
with State and local air pollution control agencies, shall
undertake a study to evaluate whether the entire metro-
politan statistical area or consolidated metropolitan statis-
tical area should be included within the nonattainment
area. Whenever a Governor finds and demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Administrator, and the Administrator
concurs in such finding, that with respect to a portion of
a metropolitan statistical area or consolidated metropoli-
tan statistical area, sources in the portion do not con-
tribute significantly to violation of the national ambient
air quality standard, the Administrator shall approve the
Governor’s request to exclude such portion from the non-
attainment area. In making such finding, the Governor
and the Administrator shall consider factors such as popu-
lation density, traffic congestion, commercial development,
industrial development, meteorological conditions, and pol-
lution transport.

Any designation for particulate matter (measured in terms
of total suspended particulates) that the Administrator
promulgated pursuant to this subsection (as in effect im-
mediately before the date of the enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990) shall remain in effect for
purposes of implementing the maximum allowable in-
creases in concentrations of particulate matter (measured
in terms of total suspended particulates) pursuant to sec-
tion 163(b), until the Administrator determines that such
designation is no longer necessary for that purpose.
(5) DESIGNATIONS FOR LEAD.—The Administrator may, in
the Administrator’s discretion at any time the Administrator
deems appropriate, require a State to designate areas (or por-
tions thereof) with respect to the national ambient air quality
standard for lead in effect as of the date of the enactment of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, in accordance with the
procedures under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1),
except that in applying subparagraph (B)(i) of paragraph (1)
the phrase ‘‘2 years from the date of promulgation of the new
or revised national ambient air quality standard’’ shall be re-
placed by the phrase ‘‘1 year from the date the Administrator
notifies the State of the requirement to designate areas with
respect to the standard for lead’’.
(6) DESIGNATIONS.—
(A) SUBMISSION.—Notwithstanding any other provision
of law, not later than February 15, 2004, the Governor of
each State shall submit designations referred to in para-
graph (1) for the July 1997 PM2.5 national ambient air
quality standards for each area within the State, based on
air quality monitoring data collected in accordance with
any applicable Federal reference methods for the relevant
areas.
(B) PROMULGATION.—Notwithstanding any other pro-
vision of law, not later than December 31, 2004, the Ad-
ministrator shall, consistent with paragraph (1), promul-
gate the designations referred to in subparagraph (A) for
each area of each State for the July 1997 PM2.5 national
ambient air quality standards.

the entire State, the State implementation plan revisions
to meet the requirements promulgated by the Adminis-
trator under section 169B(e)(1) (referred to in this para-

Air Amendments of 1970 publish, and shall from time to time
thereafter revise, a list which includes each air pollutant—
(A) emissions of which, in his judgment, cause or con-
tribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to
endanger public health or welfare;
(B) the presence of which in the ambient air results from
numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources; and
(C) for which air quality criteria had not been issued be-

Air Amendments of 1970, shall publish proposed regulations
prescribing a national primary ambient air quality standard
and a national secondary ambient air quality standard for each
air pollutant for which air quality criteria have been issued
prior to such date of enactment; and
(B) after a reasonable time for interested persons to sub-
mit written comments thereon (but no later than 90 days after
the initial publication of such proposed standards) shall by reg-
ulation promulgate such proposed national primary and sec-
ondary ambient air quality standards with such modifications
as he deems appropriate.
(2) With respect to any air pollutant for which air quality cri-
teria are issued after the date of enactment of the Clean Air
Amendments of 1970, the Administrator shall publish, simulta-
neously with the issuance of such criteria and information, pro-
posed national primary and secondary ambient air quality stand-
ards for any such pollutant. The procedure provided for in para-

such standards.
(b)(1) National primary ambient air quality standards, pre-
scribed, under subsection (a) shall be ambient air quality standards
the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the
Administrator, based on such criteria and allowing an adequate
margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health. Such
primary standards may be revised in the same manner as promul-

lation imposing or requiring the imposition of any tax, sur-
charge, fee, or other charge on parking spaces, or any other
area used for the temporary storage of motor vehicles.
(ii) The term ‘‘management of parking supply’’ shall in-
clude any requirement providing that any new facility con-
taining a given number of parking spaces shall receive a per-
mit or other prior approval, issuance of which is to be condi-
tioned on air quality considerations.
(iii) The term ‘‘preferential bus/carpool lane’’ shall include
any requirement for the setting aside of one or more lanes of
a street or highway on a permanent or temporary basis for the
exclusive use of buses or carpools, or both.
(E) No standard, plan, or requirement, relating to management
of parking supply or preferential bus/carpool lanes shall be promul-
gated after the date of enactment of this paragraph by the Admin-
istrator pursuant to this section, unless such promulgation has
been subjected to at least one public hearing which has been held
in the area affected and for which reasonable notice has been given
in such area. If substantial changes are made following public
hearings, one or more additional hearings shall be held in such
area after such notice.
(3) Upon application of the chief executive officer of any gen-
eral purpose unit of local government, if the Administrator deter-
mines that such unit has adequate authority under State or local
law, the Administrator may delegate to such unit the authority to
implement and enforce within the jurisdiction of such unit any part
of a plan promulgated under this subsection. Nothing in this para-
graph shall prevent the Administrator from implementing or en-
forcing any applicable provision of a plan promulgated under this
subsection.
(5) 16 (A) Any measure in an applicable implementation plan
which requires a toll or other charge for the use of a bridge located
entirely within one city shall be eliminated from such plan by the
Administrator upon application by the Governor of the State, which
application shall include a certification by the Governor that he
will revise such plan in accordance with subparagraph (B).
(B) In the case of any applicable implementation plan with re-
spect to which a measure has been eliminated under subparagraph
(A), such plan shall, not later than one year after the date of the
enactment of this subparagraph, be revised to include comprehen-
sive measures to:
(i) establish, expand, or improve public transportation
measures to meet basic transportation needs, as expeditiously
as is practicable; and
(ii) implement transportation control measures necessary
to attain and maintain national ambient air quality standards,

18 Section 412 of Public Law 101–549 (104 Stat. 2634) amended section 110(f)(1) by inserting
‘‘or of any requirement under section 411 (concerning excess emissions penalties or offsets) of
title IV of the Act’’ after ‘‘implmentation plan’’ without further specification. The words ‘‘imple-
mentation plan’’ appears in two places in section 110(f)(1).
and such revised plan shall, for the purpose of implementing such
comprehensive public transportation measures, include require-
ments to use (insofar as is necessary) Federal grants, State or local
funds, or any combination of such grants and funds as may be con-
sistent with the terms of the legislation providing such grants and
funds. Such measures shall, as a substitute for the tolls or charges
eliminated under subparagraph (A), provide for emissions reduc-
tions equivalent to the reductions which may reasonably be ex-
pected to be achieved through the use of the tolls or charges elimi-
nated.
(C) Any revision of any implementation plan for purposes of
meeting the requirements of subparagraph (B) shall be submitted
in coordination with any plan revision required under part D.

(f)(1) Upon application by the owner or operator of a fuel burn-
ing stationary source, and after notice and opportunity for public
hearing, the Governor of the State in which such source is located
may petition the President to determine that a national or regional
energy emergency exists of such severity that—
(A) a temporary suspension of any part of the applicable
implementation plan 18 or any requirement under section 411
(concerning excess emissions penalties or offsets) of title IV of
the Act may be necessary, and
(B) other means of responding to the energy emergency
may be inadequate.
Such determination shall not be delegable by the President to any
other person. If the President determines that a national or re-
gional energy emergency of such severity exists, a temporary emer-
gency suspension of any part of an applicable implementation
plan 18 or any requirement under section 411 (concerning excess
emissions penalties or offsets) of title IV of the Act adopted by the
State may be issued by the Governor of any State covered by the
President’s determination under the condition specified in para-
graph (2) and may take effect immediately.
(2) A temporary emergency suspension under this subsection
shall be issued to a source only if the Governor of such State finds
that— (A) there exists in the vicinity of such source a temporary
energy emergency involving high levels of unemployment or
loss of necessary energy supplies for residential dwellings; and
(B) such unemployment or loss can be totally or partially
alleviated by such emergency suspension.
Not more than one such suspension may be issued for any source
on the basis of the same set of circumstances or on the basis of the
same emergency.

order of the Administrator, if any. The Administrator may dis-
approve such suspension if he determines that it does not meet the
requirements of paragraph (2).
(4) This subsection shall not apply in the case of a plan provi-
sion or requirement promulgated by the Administrator under sub-
section (c) of this section, but in any such case the President may
grant a temporary emergency suspension for a four month period
of any such provision or requirement if he makes the determina-
tions and findings specified in paragraphs (1) and (2).
(5) The Governor may include in any temporary emergency
suspension issued under this subsection a provision delaying for a
period identical to the period of such suspension any compliance
schedule (or increment of progress) to which such source is subject
under section 119, as in effect before the date of the enactment of
this paragraph or section 113(d) 19 of this Act, upon a finding that
such source is unable to comply with such schedule (or increment)
solely because of the conditions on the basis of which a suspension
was issued under this subsection.
(g)(1) In the case of any State which has adopted and sub-
mitted to the Administrator a proposed plan revision which the
State determines—
(A) meets the requirements of this section, and
(B) is necessary (i) to prevent the closing for one year or
more of any source of air pollution, and (ii) to prevent substan-
tial increases in unemployment which would result from such
closing, and
which the Administrator has not approved or disapproved under
this section within 12 months of submission of the proposed plan
revision, the Governor may issue a temporary emergency suspen-
sion of the part of the applicable implementation plan for such
State which is proposed to be revised with respect to such source.
The determination under subparagraph (B) may not be made with
respect to a source which would close without regard whether or
not the proposed plan revision is approved.
(2) A temporary emergency suspension issued by a Governor
under this subsection shall remain in effect for a maximum of four
months or such lesser period as may be specified in a disapproval
order of the Administrator. The Administrator may disapprove
such suspension if he determines that it does not meet the require-

(h)(1) Not later than 5 years after the date of enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and every three years there-
after, the Administrator shall assemble and publish a comprehen-
sive document for each State setting forth all requirements of the
applicable implementation plan for such State and shall publish
notice in the Federal Register of the availability of such documents.
(2) The Administrator may promulgate such regulations as
may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of this sub-
section.
(i) Except for a primary nonferrous smelter order under section
119, a suspension under section 110 (f) or (g) (relating to emer-
gency suspensions), an exemption under section 118 (relating to
certain Federal facilities), an order under section 113(d) 20 (relating
to compliance orders), a plan promulgation under section 110(c), or
a plan revision under section 110(a)(3), no order, suspension, plan
revision, or other action modifying any requirement of an applica-
ble implementation plan may be taken with respect to any sta-
tionary source by the State or by the Administrator.
(j) As a condition for issuance of any permit required under
this title, the owner or operator of each new or modified stationary
source which is required to obtain such a permit must show to the
satisfaction of the permitting authority that the technological sys-
tem of continuous emission reduction which is to be used will en-
able such source to comply with the standards of performance
which are to apply to such source and that the construction or
modification and operation of such source will be in compliance
with all other requirements of this Act.
(k) ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ACTION ON PLAN
SUBMISSIONS.—
(1) COMPLETENESS OF PLAN SUBMISSIONS.—
(A) COMPLETENESS CRITERIA.—Within 9 months after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, the Administrator shall promulgate min-
imum criteria that any plan submission must meet before
the Administrator is required to act on such submission
under this subsection. The criteria shall be limited to the
information necessary to enable the Administrator to de-
termine whether the plan submission complies with the
provisions of this Act.
(B) COMPLETENESS FINDING.—Within 60 days of the
Administrator’s receipt of a plan or plan revision, but no
later than 6 months after the date, if any, by which a
State is required to submit the plan or revision, the Ad-
ministrator shall determine whether the minimum criteria
established pursuant to subparagraph (A) have been met.
Any plan or plan revision that a State submits to the Ad-
ministrator, and that has not been determined by the Ad-
ministrator (by the date 6 months after receipt of the sub-
mission) to have failed to meet the minimum criteria es-
tablished pursuant to subparagraph (A), shall on that date
be deemed by operation of law to meet such minimum cri-
teria.
(C) EFFECT OF FINDING OF INCOMPLETENESS.—Where
the Administrator determines that a plan submission (or

part thereof) does not meet the minimum criteria estab-
lished pursuant to subparagraph (A), the State shall be
treated as not having made the submission (or, in the Ad-
ministrator’s discretion, part thereof).
(2) DEADLINE FOR ACTION.—Within 12 months of a deter-
mination by the Administrator (or a determination deemed by
operation of law) under paragraph (1) that a State has sub-
mitted a plan or plan revision (or, in the Administrator’s dis-
cretion, part thereof) that meets the minimum criteria estab-
lished pursuant to paragraph (1), if applicable (or, if those cri-
teria are not applicable, within 12 months of submission of the
plan or revision), the Administrator shall act on the submis-
sion in accordance with paragraph (3).
(3) FULL AND PARTIAL APPROVAL AND DISAPPROVAL.—In the
case of any submittal on which the Administrator is required
to act under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall approve
such submittal as a whole if it meets all of the applicable re-
quirements of this Act. If a portion of the plan revision meets
all the applicable requirements of this Act, the Administrator
may approve the plan revision in part and disapprove the plan
revision in part. The plan revision shall not be treated as meet-
ing the requirements of this Act until the Administrator ap-
proves the entire plan revision as complying with the applica-
ble requirements of this Act.
(4) CONDITIONAL APPROVAL.—The Administrator may ap-
prove a plan revision based on a commitment of the State to
adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain, but not
later than 1 year after the date of approval of the plan revi-
sion. Any such conditional approval shall be treated as a dis-
approval if the State fails to comply with such commitment.
(5) CALLS FOR PLAN REVISIONS.—Whenever the Adminis-
trator finds that the applicable implementation plan for any
area is substantially inadequate to attain or maintain the rel-
evant national ambient air quality standard, to mitigate ade-
quately the interstate pollutant transport described in section
176A or section 184, or to otherwise comply with any require-
ment of this Act, the Administrator shall require the State to
revise the plan as necessary to correct such inadequacies. The
Administrator shall notify the State of the inadequacies, and
may establish reasonable deadlines (not to exceed 18 months
after the date of such notice) for the submission of such plan
revisions. Such findings and notice shall be public. Any finding
under this paragraph shall, to the extent the Administrator
deems appropriate, subject the State to the requirements of
this Act to which the State was subject when it developed and
submitted the plan for which such finding was made, except
that the Administrator may adjust any dates applicable under
such requirements as appropriate (except that the Adminis-
trator may not adjust any attainment date prescribed under
part D, unless such date has elapsed).
(6) CORRECTIONS.—Whenever the Administrator deter-
mines that the Administrator’s action approving, disapproving,
or promulgating any plan or plan revision (or part thereof),
area designation, redesignation, classification, or reclassifica-

tion was in error, the Administrator may in the same manner
as the approval, disapproval, or promulgation revise such ac-
tion as appropriate without requiring any further submission
from the State. Such determination and the basis thereof shall
be provided to the State and public.
(l) PLAN REVISIONS.—Each revision to an implementation plan
submitted by a State under this Act shall be adopted by such State
after reasonable notice and public hearing. The Administrator shall
not approve a revision of a plan if the revision would interfere with
any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable
further progress (as defined in section 171), or any other applicable
requirement of this Act.
(m) SANCTIONS.—The Administrator may apply any of the
sanctions listed in section 179(b) at any time (or at any time after)
the Administrator makes a finding, disapproval, or determination
under paragraphs (1) through (4), respectively, of section 179(a) in
relation to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by the
Administrator) required under this Act, with respect to any portion
of the State the Administrator determines reasonable and appro-
priate, for the purpose of ensuring that the requirements of this
Act relating to such plan or plan item are met. The Administrator
shall, by rule, establish criteria for exercising his authority under
the previous sentence with respect to any deficiency referred to in
section 179(a) to ensure that, during the 24-month period following
the finding, disapproval, or determination referred to in section
179(a), such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where
one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable imple-
mentation plan are principally responsible for such deficiency.
(n) SAVINGS CLAUSES.—
(1) E XISTING PLAN PROVISIONS.—Any provision of any ap-
plicable implementation plan that was approved or promul-
gated by the Administrator pursuant to this section as in effect
before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990 shall remain in effect as part of such applicable
implementation plan, except to the extent that a revision to
such provision is approved or promulgated by the Adminis-
trator pursuant to this Act.
(2) ATTAINMENT DATES.—For any area not designated non-
attainment, any plan or plan revision submitted or required to
be submitted by a State—
(A) in response to the promulgation or revision of a
national primary ambient air quality standard in effect on
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, or
(B) in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy
under subsection (a)(2) (as in effect immediately before the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990),
shall provide for attainment of the national primary ambient
air quality standards within 3 years of the date of the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 or within 5
years of issuance of such finding of substantial inadequacy,
whichever is later.

AREAS.—In the case of an area to which, immediately before
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, the prohibition on construction or modification of
major stationary sources prescribed in subsection (a)(2)(I) (as
in effect immediately before the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) applied by virtue of a find-
ing of the Administrator that the State containing such area
had not submitted an implementation plan meeting the re-
quirements of section 172(b)(6) (relating to establishment of a
permit program) (as in effect immediately before the date of
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) or
172(a)(1) (to the extent such requirements relate to provision
for attainment of the primary national ambient air quality
standard for sulfur oxides by December 31, 1982) as in effect
immediately before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990, no major stationary source of the rel-
evant air pollutant or pollutants shall be constructed or modi-
fied in such area until the Administrator finds that the plan
for such area meets the applicable requirements of section
172(c)(5) (relating to permit programs) or subpart 5 of part D
(relating to attainment of the primary national ambient air
quality standard for sulfur dioxide), respectively.
(o) I NDIAN TRIBES.—If an Indian tribe submits an implementa-
tion plan to the Administrator pursuant to section 301(d), the plan
shall be reviewed in accordance with the provisions for review set
forth in this section for State plans, except as otherwise provided
by regulation promulgated pursuant to section 301(d)(2). When
such plan becomes effective in accordance with the regulations pro-
mulgated under section 301(d), the plan shall become applicable to
all areas (except as expressly provided otherwise in the plan) lo-
cated within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, notwith-
standing the issuance of any patent and including rights-of-way
running through the reservation.
(p) REPORTS.—Any State shall submit, according to such sched-
ule as the Administrator may prescribe, such reports as the Admin-
istrator may require relating to emission reductions, vehicle miles
traveled, congestion levels, and any other information the Adminis-
trator may deem necessary to assess the development effectiveness,
need for revision, or implementation of any plan or plan revision
required under this Act.

STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR NEW STATIONARY SOURCES
SEC. 111. (a) For purposes of this section:
(1) The term ‘‘standard of performance’’ means a standard
for emissions of air pollutants which reflects the degree of
emission limitation achievable through the application of the
best system of emission reduction which (taking into account
the cost of achieving such reduction and any nonair quality
health and environmental impact and energy requirements)
the Administrator determines has been adequately dem-
onstrated.

22 For related provisions, see section 301 of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of
1978 (as amended by section 1021 of Public Law 97–35).
(2) The term ‘‘new source’’ means any stationary source,
the construction or modification of which is commenced after
the publication of regulations (or, if earlier, proposed regula-
tions) prescribing a standard of performance under this section
which will be applicable to such source.
(3) The term ‘‘stationary source’’ means any building,
structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any
air pollutant. Nothing in title II of this Act relating to nonroad
engines shall be construed to apply to stationary internal com-
bustion engines.
(4) The term ‘‘modification’’ means any physical change in,
or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source
which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by
such source or which results in the emission of any air pollut-
ant not previously emitted.
(5) The term ‘‘owner or operator’’ means any person who
owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a stationary
source.
(6) The term ‘‘existing source’’ means any stationary source
other than a new source.
(7) The term ‘‘technological system of continuous emission
reduction’’ means—
(A) a technological process for production or operation
by any source which is inherently low-polluting or nonpol-
luting, or
(B) a technological system for continuous reduction of
the pollution generated by a source before such pollution
is emitted into the ambient air, including precombustion
cleaning or treatment of fuels.
(8) A conversion to coal (A) by reason of an order under
section 2(a) of the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordi-
nation Act of 1974 or any amendment thereto, or any subse-
quent enactment which supersedes such Act, or (B) which
qualifies under section 113(d)(5)(A)(ii) 21 of this Act, shall not
be deemed to be a modification for purposes of paragraphs (2)
and (4) of this subsection. 22
(b)(1)(A) The Administrator shall, within 90 days after the date
of enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, publish (and
from time to time thereafter shall revise) a list of categories of sta-
tionary sources. He shall include a category of sources in such list
if in his judgment it causes, or contributes significantly to, air pol-
lution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public
health or welfare.
(B) Within one year after the inclusion of a category of sta-
tionary sources in a list under subparagraph (A), the Administrator
shall publish proposed regulations, establishing Federal standards
of performance for new sources within such category. The Adminis-
trator shall afford interested persons an opportunity for written
comment on such proposed regulations. After considering such com-
ments, he shall promulgate, within one year after such publication,
such standards with such modifications as he deems appropriate.

23 The reference in paragraph (6) to ‘‘subsection (a)(1)(A) (i) and (ii)’’ is so in law. Subsection
(a) does not contain subparagraphs.
The Administrator shall, at least every 8 years, review and, if ap-
propriate, revise such standards following the procedure required
by this subsection for promulgation of such standards. Notwith-
standing the requirements of the previous sentence, the Adminis-
trator need not review any such standard if the Administrator de-
termines that such review is not appropriate in light of readily
available information on the efficacy of such standard. Standards
of performance or revisions thereof shall become effective upon pro-
mulgation. When implementation and enforcement of any require-
ment of this Act indicate that emission limitations and percent re-
ductions beyond those required by the standards promulgated
under this section are achieved in practice, the Administrator shall,
when revising standards promulgated under this section, consider
the emission limitations and percent reductions achieved in prac-
tice. (2) The Administrator may distinguish among classes, types,
and sizes within categories of new sources for the purpose of estab-
lishing such standards.
(3) The Administrator shall, from time to time, issue informa-
tion on pollution control techniques for categories of new sources
and air pollutants subject to the provisions of this section.
(4) The provisions of this section shall apply to any new source
owned or operated by the United States.
(5) Except as otherwise authorized under subsection (h), noth-
ing in this section shall be construed to require, or to authorize the
Administrator to require, any new or modified source to install and
operate any particular technological system of continuous emission
reduction to comply with any new source standard of performance.
(6) The revised standards of performance required by enact-
ment of subsection (a)(1)(A) (i) and (ii) 23 shall be promulgated not
later than one year after enactment of this paragraph. Any new or
modified fossil fuel fired stationary source which commences con-
struction prior to the date of publication of the proposed revised
standards shall not be required to comply with such revised stand-
ards.
(c)(1) Each State may develop and submit to the Administrator
a procedure for implementing and enforcing standards of perform-
ance for new sources located in such State. If the Administrator
finds the State procedure is adequate, he shall delegate to such
State any authority he has under this Act to implement and en-
force such standards.
(2) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the Administrator
from enforcing any applicable standard of performance under this
section.
(d)(1) The Administrator shall prescribe regulations which
shall establish a procedure similar to that provided by section 110
under which each State shall submit to the Administrator a plan
which (A) establishes standards of performance for any existing
source for any air pollutant (i) for which air quality criteria have
not been issued or which is not included on a list published under

of performance under this section would apply if such existing
source were a new source, and (B) provides for the implementation
and enforcement of such standards of performance. Regulations of
the Administrator under this paragraph shall permit the State in
applying a standard of performance to any particular source under
a plan submitted under this paragraph to take into consideration,
among other factors, the remaining useful life of the existing source
to which such standard applies.
(2) The Administrator shall have the same authority—
(A) to prescribe a plan for a State in cases where the State
fails to submit a satisfactory plan as he would have under sec-
tion 110(c) in the case of failure to submit an implementation
plan, and
(B) to enforce the provisions of such plan in cases where
the State fails to enforce them as he would have under sections
113 and 114 with respect to an implementation plan. In pro-
mulgating a standard of performance under a plan prescribed
under this paragraph, the Administrator shall take into consid-
eration, among other factors, remaining useful lives of the
sources in the category of sources to which such standard ap-
plies.
(e) After the effective date of standards of performance promul-
gated under this section, it shall be unlawful for any owner or oper-
ator of any new source to operate such source in violation of any
standard of performance applicable to such source.
(f)(1) For those categories of major stationary sources that the
Administrator listed under subsection (b)(1)(A) before the date of
the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and for
which regulations had not been proposed by the Administrator by
such date, the Administrator shall—
(A) propose regulations establishing standards of perform-
ance for at least 25 percent of such categories of sources within
2 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990;
(B) propose regulations establishing standards of perform-
ance for at least 50 percent of such categories of sources within
4 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990; and
(C) propose regulations for the remaining categories of
sources within 6 years after the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
(2) In determining priorities for promulgating standards for
categories of major stationary sources for the purpose of paragraph
(1), the Administrator shall consider—
(A) the quantity of air pollutant emissions which each such
category will emit, or will be designed to emit;
(B) the extent to which each such pollutant may reason-
ably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare; and

(C) the mobility and competitive nature of each such cat-
egory of sources and the consequent need for nationally appli-
cable new source standards of performance.
(3) Before promulgating any regulations under this subsection
or listing any category of major stationary sources as required
under this subsection, the Administrator shall consult with appro-
priate representatives of the Governors and of State air pollution
control agencies.
(g)(1) Upon application by the Governor of a State showing
that the Administrator has failed to specify in regulations under
subsection (f)(1) any category of major stationary sources required
to be specified under such regulations, the Administrator shall re-
vise such regulations, to specify any such category.
(2) Upon application of the Governor of a State, showing that
any category of stationary sources which is not included in the list
under subsection (b)(1)(A) contributes significantly to air pollution
which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or
welfare (notwithstanding that such category is not a category of
major stationary sources), the Administrator shall revise such regu-
lations to specify such category of stationary sources.
(3) Upon application of the Governor of a State showing that
the Administrator has failed to apply properly the criteria required
to be considered under subsection (f)(2), the Administrator shall re-
vise the list under subsection (b)(1)(A) to apply properly such cri-
teria.
(4) Upon application of the Governor of a State showing that—
(A) a new, innovative, or improved technology or process
which achieves greater continuous emission reduction has been
adequately demonstrated for any category of stationary
sources, and
(B) as a result of such technology or process, the new
source standard of performance in effect under this section for
such category no longer reflects the greatest degree of emission
limitation achievable through application of the best techno-
logical system of continuous emission reduction which (taking
into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduc-
tion, and any non-air quality health and environmental impact
and energy requirements) has been adequately demonstrated,
the Administrator shall revise such standard of performance for
such category accordingly.
(5) Unless later deadlines for action of the Administrator are
otherwise prescribed under this section, the Administrator shall,
not later than three months following the date of receipt of any ap-
plication by a Governor of a State, either—
(A) find that such application does not contain the req-
uisite showing and deny such application, or
(B) grant such application and take the action required
under this subsection.
(6) Before taking any action required by subsection (f) or by
this subsection, the Administrator shall provide notice and oppor-
tunity for public hearing.
(h)(1) For purposes of this section, if in the judgment of the Ad-
ministrator, it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce a standard of
performance, he may instead promulgate a design, equipment,

work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof,
which reflects the best technological system of continuous emission
reduction which (taking into consideration the cost of achieving
such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and envi-
ronmental impact and energy requirements) the Administrator de-
termines has been adequately demonstrated. In the event the Ad-
ministrator promulgates a design or equipment standard under
this subsection, he shall include as part of such standard such re-
quirements as will assure the proper operation and maintenance of
any such element of design or equipment.
(2) For the purpose of this subsection, the phrase ‘‘not feasible
to prescribe or enforce a standard of performance’’ means any situ-
ation in which the Administrator determines that (A) a pollutant
or pollutants cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and
constructed to emit or capture such pollutant, or that any require-
ment for, or use of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent with
any Federal, State, or local law, or (B) the application of measure-
ment methodology to a particular class of sources is not practicable
due to technological or economic limitations.
(3) If after notice and opportunity for public hearing, any per-
son establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an al-
ternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in
emissions of any air pollutant at least equivalent to the reduction
in emissions of such air pollutant achieved under the requirements
of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall permit the use of such al-
ternative by the source for purposes of compliance with this section
with respect to such pollutant.
(4) Any standard promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be
promulgated in terms of standard of performance whenever it be-
comes feasible to promulgate and enforce such standard in such
terms.
(5) Any design, equipment, work practice, or operational stand-
ard, or any combination thereof, described in this subsection shall
be treated as a standard of performance for purposes of the provi-
sions of this Act (other than the provisions of subsection (a) and
this subsection).
(i) Any regulations promulgated by the Administrator under
this section applicable to grain elevators shall not apply to country
elevators (as defined by the Administrator) which have a storage
capacity of less than two million five hundred thousand bushels.
(j)(1)(A) Any person proposing to own or operate a new source
may request the Administrator for one or more waivers from the
requirements of this section for such source or any portion thereof
with respect to any air pollutant to encourage the use of an innova-
tive technological system or systems of continuous emission reduc-
tion. The Administrator may, with the consent of the Governor of
the State in which the source is to be located, grant a waiver under
this paragraph, if the Administrator determines after notice and
opportunity for public hearing, that—
(i) the proposed system or systems have not been ade-
quately demonstrated,
(ii) the proposed system or systems will operate effectively
and there is a substantial likelihood that such system or sys-
tems will achieve greater continuous emission reduction than

that required to be achieved under the standards of perform-
ance which would otherwise apply, or achieve at least an
equivalent reduction at lower cost in terms of energy, eco-
nomic, or nonair quality environmental impact.
(iii) the owner or operator of the proposed source has dem-
onstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the pro-
posed system will not cause or contribute to an unreasonable
risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation, func-
tion, or malfunction, and
(iv) the granting of such waiver is consistent with the re-
quirements of subparagraph (C).
In making any determination under clause (ii), the Administrator
shall take into account any previous failure of such system or sys-
tems to operate effectively or to meet any requirement of the new
source performance standards. In determining whether an unrea-
sonable risk exists under clause (iii), the Administrator shall con-
sider, among other factors, whether and to what extent the use of
the proposed technological system will cause, increase, reduce, or
eliminate emissions of any unregulated pollutants; available meth-
ods for reducing or eliminating any risk to public health, welfare,
or safety which may be associated with the use of such system; and
the availability of other technological systems which may be used
to conform to standards under this section without causing or con-
tributing to such unreasonable risk. The Administrator may con-
duct such tests and may require the owner or operator of the pro-
posed source to conduct such tests and provide such information as
is necessary to carry out clause (iii) of this subparagraph. Such re-
quirements shall include a requirement for prompt reporting of the
emission of any unregulated pollutant from a system if such pollut-
ant was not emitted, or was emitted in significantly lesser amounts
without use of such system.
(B) A waiver under this paragraph shall be granted on such
terms and conditions as the Administrator determines to be nec-
essary to assure—
(i) emissions from the source will not prevent attainment
and maintenance of any national ambient air quality stand-
ards, and
(ii) proper functioning of the technological system or sys-
tems authorized.
Any such term or condition shall be treated as a standard of per-
formance for the purposes of subsection (e) of this section and sec-
tion 113.
(C) The number of waivers granted under this paragraph with
respect to a proposed technological system of continuous emission
reduction shall not exceed such number as the Administrator finds
necessary to ascertain whether or not such system will achieve the
conditions specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A).
(D) A waiver under this paragraph shall extend to the sooner
of—
(i) the date determined by the Administrator, after con-
sultation with the owner or operator of the source, taking into
consideration the design, installation, and capital cost of the
technological system or systems being used, or

such system has failed to—
(I) achieve at least an equivalent continuous emission
reduction to that required to be achieved under the stand-
ards of performance which would otherwise apply, or
(II) comply with the condition specified in paragraph
(1)(A)(iii),
and that such failure cannot be corrected.
(E) In carrying out subparagraph (D)(i), the Administrator
shall not permit any waiver for a source or portion thereof to ex-
tend beyond the date—
(i) seven years after the date on which any waiver is
granted to such source or portion thereof, or
(ii) four years after the date on which such source or por-
tion thereof commences operation,
whichever is earlier.
(F) No waiver under this subsection shall apply to any portion
of a source other than the portion on which the innovative techno-
logical system or systems of continuous emission reduction is used.
(2)(A) If a waiver under paragraph (1) is terminated under
clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(D), the Administrator shall grant an ex-
tension of the requirements of this section for such source for such
minimum period as may be necessary to comply with the applicable
standard of performance under this section. Such period shall not
extend beyond the date three years from the time such waiver is
terminated.
(B) An extension granted under this paragraph shall set forth
emission limits and a compliance schedule containing increments of
progress which require compliance with the applicable standards of
performance as expeditiously as practicable and include such meas-
ures as are necessary and practicable in the interim to minimize
emissions. Such schedule shall be treated as a standard of perform-
ance for purposes of subsection (e) of this section and section 113.

SEC. 112. HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS.
(a) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section, except sub-
section (r)—
(1) MAJOR SOURCE.—The term ‘‘major source’’ means any
stationary source or group of stationary sources located within
a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has
the potential to emit considering controls, in the aggregate, 10
tons per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons
per year or more of any combination of hazardous air pollut-
ants. The Administrator may establish a lesser quantity, or in
the case of radionuclides different criteria, for a major source
than that specified in the previous sentence, on the basis of the
potency of the air pollutant, persistence, potential for bio-
accumulation, other characteristics of the air pollutant, or
other relevant factors.
(2) AREA SOURCE.—The term ‘‘area source’’ means any sta-
tionary source of hazardous air pollutants that is not a major
source. For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘area source’’

tionary source the construction or reconstruction of which is
commenced after the Administrator first proposes regulations
under this section establishing an emission standard applicable
to such source.
(5) MODIFICATION.—The term ‘‘modification’’ means any
physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a
major source which increases the actual emissions of any haz-
ardous air pollutant emitted by such source by more than a de
minimis amount or which results in the emission of any haz-
ardous air pollutant not previously emitted by more than a de
minimis amount.
(6) HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANT.—The term ‘‘hazardous air
pollutant’’ means any air pollutant listed pursuant to sub-
section (b).

1 X’CN where X = H’ or any other group where a formal dissociation may occur.
For example KCN or Ca(CN)2
2 Includes mono- and di- ethers of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and
triethylene glycol R–(OCH2CH2)n–OR’ where
n = 1, 2, or 3
R = alkyl or aryl groups
R’ = R, H, or groups which, when removed, yield glycol ethers with the struc-
ture: R–(OCH2CH)n–OH. Polymers are excluded from the glycol category.
3 Includes mineral fiber emissions from facilities manufacturing or processing
glass, rock, or slag fibers (or other mineral derived fibers) of average diameter 1 mi-
crometer or less.
4 Includes organic compounds with more than one benzene ring, and which have a
boiling point greater than or equal to 100°C.
5 A type of atom which spontaneously undergoes radioactive decay.
(2) REVISION OF THE LIST.—The Administrator shall peri-
odically review the list established by this subsection and pub-
lish the results thereof and, where appropriate, revise such list
by rule, adding pollutants which present, or may present,
through inhalation or other routes of exposure, a threat of ad-
verse human health effects (including, but not limited to, sub-
stances which are known to be, or may reasonably be antici-
pated to be, carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, neurotoxic,
which cause reproductive dysfunction, or which are acutely or
chronically toxic) or adverse environmental effects whether
through ambient concentrations, bioaccumulation, deposition,
or otherwise, but not including releases subject to regulation
under subsection (r) as a result of emissions to the air. No air
pollutant which is listed under section 108(a) may be added to
the list under this section, except that the prohibition of this
sentence shall not apply to any pollutant which independently
meets the listing criteria of this paragraph and is a precursor
to a pollutant which is listed under section 108(a) or to any
pollutant which is in a class of pollutants listed under such
section. No substance, practice, process or activity regulated
under title VI of this Act shall be subject to regulation under
this section solely due to its adverse effects on the environ-
ment.
(3) PETITIONS TO MODIFY THE LIST.—
(A) Beginning at any time after 6 months after the
date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, any person may petition the Administrator to modify
the list of hazardous air pollutants under this subsection
by adding or deleting a substance or, in case of listed pol-
lutants without CAS numbers (other than coke oven emis-
sions, mineral fibers, or polycyclic organic matter) remov-
ing certain unique substances. Within 18 months after re-
ceipt of a petition, the Administrator shall either grant or
deny the petition by publishing a written explanation of
the reasons for the Administrator’s decision. Any such pe-
tition shall include a showing by the petitioner that there
is adequate data on the health or environmental defects 26
of the pollutant or other evidence adequate to support the
petition. The Administrator may not deny a petition solely
on the basis of inadequate resources or time for review.

(B) The Administrator shall add a substance to the list
upon a showing by the petitioner or on the Administrator’s
own determination that the substance is an air pollutant
and that emissions, ambient concentrations, bioaccumula-
tion or deposition of the substance are known to cause or
may reasonably be anticipated to cause adverse effects to
human health or adverse environmental effects.
(C) The Administrator shall delete a substance from
the list upon a showing by the petitioner or on the Admin-
istrator’s own determination that there is adequate data
on the health and environmental effects of the substance
to determine that emissions, ambient concentrations, bio-
accumulation or deposition of the substance may not rea-
sonably be anticipated to cause any adverse effects to the
human health or adverse environmental effects.
(D) The Administrator shall delete one or more unique
chemical substances that contain a listed hazardous air
pollutant not having a CAS number (other than coke oven
emissions, mineral fibers, or polycyclic organic matter)
upon a showing by the petitioner or on the Administrator’s
own determination that such unique chemical substances
that contain the named chemical of such listed hazardous
air pollutant meet the deletion requirements of subpara-
graph (C). The Administrator must grant or deny a dele-
tion petition prior to promulgating any emission standards
pursuant to subsection (d) applicable to any source cat-
egory or subcategory of a listed hazardous air pollutant
without a CAS number listed under subsection (b) for
which a deletion petition has been filed within 12 months
of the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990.
(4) FURTHER INFORMATION.—If the Administrator deter-
mines that information on the health or environmental effects
of a substance is not sufficient to make a determination re-
quired by this subsection, the Administrator may use any au-
thority available to the Administrator to acquire such informa-
tion.(5) TEST METHODS.—The Administrator may establish, by
rule, test measures and other analytic procedures for moni-
toring and measuring emissions, ambient concentrations, depo-
sition, and bioaccumulation of hazardous air pollutants.
(6) PREVENTION OF SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION.—The pro-
visions of part C (prevention of significant deterioration) shall
not apply to pollutants listed under this section.
(7) LEAD.—The Administrator may not list elemental lead
as a hazardous air pollutant under this subsection.
(c) LIST OF SOURCE CATEGORIES.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 12 months after the date
of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the
Administrator shall publish, and shall from time to time, but
no less often than every 8 years, revise, if appropriate, in re-
sponse to public comment or new information, a list of all cat-
egories and subcategories of major sources and area sources
(listed under paragraph (3)) of the air pollutants listed pursu-

ant to subsection (b). To the extent practicable, the categories
and subcategories listed under this subsection shall be con-
sistent with the list of source categories established pursuant
to section 111 and part C. Nothing in the preceding sentence
limits the Administrator’s authority to establish subcategories
under this section, as appropriate.
(2) REQUIREMENT FOR EMISSIONS STANDARDS.—For the cat-
egories and subcategories the Administrator lists, the Adminis-
trator shall establish emissions standards under subsection (d),
according to the schedule in this subsection and subsection (e).
(3) AREA SOURCES.—The Administrator shall list under
this subsection each category or subcategory of area sources
which the Administrator finds presents a threat of adverse ef-
fects to human health or the environment (by such sources in-
dividually or in the aggregate) warranting regulation under
this section. The Administrator shall, not later than 5 years
after the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 and pursuant to subsection (k)(3)(B), list, based on ac-
tual or estimated aggregate emissions of a listed pollutant or
pollutants, sufficient categories or subcategories of area
sources to ensure that area sources representing 90 percent of
the area source emissions of the 30 hazardous air pollutants
that present the greatest threat to public health in the largest
number of urban areas are subject to regulation under this sec-
tion. Such regulations shall be promulgated not later than 10
years after such date of enactment.
(4) PREVIOUSLY REGULATED CATEGORIES.—The Adminis-
trator may, in the Administrator’s discretion, list any category
or subcategory of sources previously regulated under this sec-
tion as in effect before the date of enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990.
(5) ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES.—In addition to those cat-
egories and subcategories of sources listed for regulation pur-
suant to paragraphs (1) and (3), the Administrator may at any
time list additional categories and subcategories of sources of
hazardous air pollutants according to the same criteria for list-
ing applicable under such paragraphs. In the case of source
categories and subcategories listed after publication of the ini-
tial list required under paragraph (1) or (3), emission stand-
ards under subsection (d) for the category or subcategory shall
be promulgated within 10 years after the date of enactment of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, or within 2 years after
the date on which such category or subcategory is listed,
whichever is later.
(6) SPECIFIC POLLUTANTS.—With respect to alkylated lead
compounds, polycyclic organic matter, hexachlorobenzene, mer-
cury, polychlorinated biphenyls, 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzofurans and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin, the Administrator shall, not later than 5 years after the
date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
list categories and subcategories of sources assuring that
sources accounting for not less than 90 per centum of the ag-
gregate emissions of each such pollutant are subject to stand-
ards under subsection (d)(2) or (d)(4). Such standards shall be

promulgated not later than 10 years after such date of enact-
ment. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Ad-
ministrator to promulgate standards for such pollutants emit-
ted by electric utility steam generating units.
(7) RESEARCH FACILITIES.—The Administrator shall estab-
lish a separate category covering research or laboratory facili-
ties, as necessary to assure the equitable treatment of such fa-
cilities. For purposes of this section, ‘‘research or laboratory fa-
cility’’ means any stationary source whose primary purpose is
to conduct research and development into new processes and
products, where such source is operated under the close super-
vision of technically trained personnel and is not engaged in
the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce,
except in a de minimis manner.
(8) BOAT MANUFACTURING.—When establishing emissions
standards for styrene, the Administrator shall list boat manu-
facturing as a separate subcategory unless the Administrator
finds that such listing would be inconsistent with the goals and
requirements of this Act.
(9) DELETIONS FROM THE LIST.—
(A) Where the sole reason for the inclusion of a source
category on the list required under this subsection is the
emission of a unique chemical substance, the Adminis-
trator shall delete the source category from the list if it is
appropriate because of action taken under either subpara-
graphs (C) or (D) of subsection (b)(3).
(B) The Administrator may delete any source category
from the list under this subsection, on petition of any per-
son or on the Administrator’s own motion, whenever the
Administrator makes the following determination or deter-
minations, as applicable:
(i) In the case of hazardous air pollutants emitted
by sources in the category that may result in cancer
in humans, a determination that no source in the cat-
egory (or group of sources in the case of area sources)
emits such hazardous air pollutants in quantities
which may cause a lifetime risk of cancer greater than
one in one million to the individual in the population
who is most exposed to emissions of such pollutants
from the source (or group of sources in the case of area
sources).
(ii) In the case of hazardous air pollutants that
may result in adverse health effects in humans other
than cancer or adverse environmental effects, a deter-
mination that emissions from no source in the cat-
egory or subcategory concerned (or group of sources in
the case of area sources) exceed a level which is ade-
quate to protect public health with an ample margin
of safety and no adverse environmental effect will re-
sult from emissions from any source (or from a group
of sources in the case of area sources).
The Administrator shall grant or deny a petition under this
paragraph within 1 year after the petition is filed.
(d) EMISSION STANDARDS.—

As Amended Through P.L. 117-286, Enacted December 27, 2022
61 Sec. 112CLEAN AIR ACT
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall promulgate reg-
ulations establishing emission standards for each category or
subcategory of major sources and area sources of hazardous air
pollutants listed for regulation pursuant to subsection (c) in ac-
cordance with the schedules provided in subsections (c) and (e).
The Administrator may distinguish among classes, types, and
sizes of sources within a category or subcategory in estab-
lishing such standards except that, there shall be no delay in
the compliance date for any standard applicable to any source
under subsection (i) as the result of the authority provided by
this sentence.
(2) STANDARDS AND METHODS.—Emissions standards pro-
mulgated under this subsection and applicable to new or exist-
ing sources of hazardous air pollutants shall require the max-
imum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air
pollutants subject to this section (including a prohibition on
such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, tak-
ing into consideration the cost of achieving such emission re-
duction, and any non-air quality health and environmental im-
pacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable for
new or existing sources in the category or subcategory to which
such emission standard applies, through application of meas-
ures, processes, methods, systems or techniques including, but
not limited to, measures which—
(A) reduce the volume of, or eliminate emissions of,
such pollutants through process changes, substitution of
materials or other modifications,
(B) enclose systems or processes to eliminate emis-
sions,
(C) collect, capture or treat such pollutants when re-
leased from a process, stack, storage or fugitive emissions
point,
(D) are design, equipment, work practice, or oper-
ational standards (including requirements for operator
training or certification) as provided in subsection (h), or
(E) are a combination of the above.
None of the measures described in subparagraphs (A) through
(D) shall, consistent with the provisions of section 114(c), in
any way compromise any United States patent or United
States trademark right, or any confidential business informa-
tion, or any trade secret or any other intellectual property
right.
(3) NEW AND EXISTING SOURCES.—The maximum degree of
reduction in emissions that is deemed achievable for new
sources in a category or subcategory shall not be less stringent
than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the
best controlled similar source, as determined by the Adminis-
trator. Emission standards promulgated under this subsection
for existing sources in a category or subcategory may be less
stringent than standards for new sources in the same category
or subcategory but shall not be less stringent, and may be
more stringent than—
(A) the average emission limitation achieved by the
best performing 12 percent of the existing sources (for

which the Administrator has emissions information), ex-
cluding those sources that have, within 18 months before
the emission standard is proposed or within 30 months be-
fore such standard is promulgated, whichever is later, first
achieved a level of emission rate or emission reduction
which complies, or would comply if the source is not sub-
ject to such standard, with the lowest achievable emission
rate (as defined by section 171) applicable to the source
category and prevailing at the time, in the category or sub-
category for categories and subcategories with 30 or more
sources, or
(B) the average emission limitation achieved by the
best performing 5 sources (for which the Administrator has
or could reasonably obtain emissions information) in the
category or subcategory for categories or subcategories
with fewer than 30 sources.
(4) HEALTH THRESHOLD.—With respect to pollutants for
which a health threshold has been established, the Adminis-
trator may consider such threshold level, with an ample mar-
gin of safety, when establishing emission standards under this
subsection.
(5) ALTERNATIVE STANDARD FOR AREA SOURCES.—With re-
spect only to categories and subcategories of area sources listed
pursuant to subsection (c), the Administrator may, in lieu of
the authorities provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (f),
elect to promulgate standards or requirements applicable to
sources in such categories or subcategories which provide for
the use of generally available control technologies or manage-
ment practices by such sources to reduce emissions of haz-
ardous air pollutants.
(6) REVIEW AND REVISION.—The Administrator shall re-
view, and revise as necessary (taking into account develop-
ments in practices, processes, and control technologies), emis-
sion standards promulgated under this section no less often
than every 8 years.
(7) OTHER REQUIREMENTS PRESERVED.—No emission stand-
ard or other requirement promulgated under this section shall
be interpreted, construed or applied to diminish or replace the
requirements of a more stringent emission limitation or other
applicable requirement established pursuant to section 111,
part C or D, or other authority of this Act or a standard issued
under State authority.
(8) COKE OVENS.—
(A) Not later than December 31, 1992, the Adminis-
trator shall promulgate regulations establishing emission
standards under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection
for coke oven batteries. In establishing such standards, the
Administrator shall evaluate—
(i) the use of sodium silicate (or equivalent) luting
compounds to prevent door leaks, and other operating
practices and technologies for their effectiveness in re-
ducing coke oven emissions, and their suitability for
use on new and existing coke oven batteries, taking

into account costs and reasonable commercial door
warranties; and
(ii) as a basis for emission standards under this
subsection for new coke oven batteries that begin con-
struction after the date of proposal of such standards,
the Jewell design Thompson non-recovery coke oven
batteries and other non-recovery coke oven tech-
nologies, and other appropriate emission control and
coke production technologies, as to their effectiveness
in reducing coke oven emissions and their capability
for production of steel quality coke.
Such regulations shall require at a minimum that coke
oven batteries will not exceed 8 per centum leaking doors,
1 per centum leaking lids, 5 per centum leaking offtakes,
and 16 seconds visible emissions per charge, with no exclu-
sion for emissions during the period after the closing of
self-sealing oven doors. Notwithstanding subsection (i), the
compliance date for such emission standards for existing
coke oven batteries shall be December 31, 1995.
(B) The Administrator shall promulgate work practice
regulations under this subsection for coke oven batteries
requiring, as appropriate—
(i) the use of sodium silicate (or equivalent) luting
compounds, if the Administrator determines that use
of sodium silicate is an effective means of emissions
control and is achievable, taking into account costs
and reasonable commercial warranties for doors and
related equipment; and
(ii) door and jam cleaning practices.
Notwithstanding subsection (i), the compliance date for
such work practice regulations for coke oven batteries
shall be not later than the date 3 years after the date of
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
(C) For coke oven batteries electing to qualify for an
extension of the compliance date for standards promul-
gated under subsection (f) in accordance with subsection
(i)(8), the emission standards under this subsection for
coke oven batteries shall require that coke oven batteries
not exceed 8 per centum leaking doors, 1 per centum leak-
ing lids, 5 per centum leaking offtakes, and 16 seconds
visible emissions per charge, with no exclusion for emis-
sions during the period after the closing of self-sealing
doors. Notwithstanding subsection (i), the compliance date
for such emission standards for existing coke oven bat-
teries seeking an extension shall be not later than the date
3 years after the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990.
(9) SOURCES LICENSED BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COM-
MISSION.—No standard for radionuclide emissions from any
category or subcategory of facilities licensed by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (or an Agreement State) is required to
be promulgated under this section if the Administrator deter-
mines, by rule, and after consultation with the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission, that the regulatory program established by

Energy Act for such category or subcategory provides an ample
margin of safety to protect the public health. Nothing in this
subsection shall preclude or deny the right of any State or po-
litical subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce any standard or
limitation respecting emissions of radionuclides which is more
stringent than the standard or limitation in effect under sec-
tion 111 or this section.
(10) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Emission standards or other regu-
lations promulgated under this subsection shall be effective
upon promulgation.
(e) S CHEDULE FOR STANDARDS AND REVIEW.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall promulgate reg-
ulations establishing emission standards for categories and
subcategories of sources initially listed for regulation pursuant
to subsection (c)(1) as expeditiously as practicable, assuring
that— (A) emission standards for not less than 40 categories
and subcategories (not counting coke oven batteries) shall
be promulgated not later than 2 years after the date of en-
actment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990;
(B) emission standards for coke oven batteries shall be
promulgated not later than December 31, 1992;
(C) emission standards for 25 per centum of the listed
categories and subcategories shall be promulgated not
later than 4 years after the date of enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990;
(D) emission standards for an additional 25 per cen-
tum of the listed categories and subcategories shall be pro-
mulgated not later than 7 years after the date of enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; and
(E) emission standards for all categories and subcat-
egories shall be promulgated not later than 10 years after
the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990.
(2) In determining priorities for promulgating standards
under subsection (d), the Administrator shall consider—
(A) the known or anticipated adverse effects of such
pollutants on public health and the environment;
(B) the quantity and location of emissions or reason-
ably anticipated emissions of hazardous air pollutants that
each category or subcategory will emit; and
(C) the efficiency of grouping categories or subcat-
egories according to the pollutants emitted, or the proc-
esses or technologies used.
(3) PUBLISHED SCHEDULE.—Not later than 24 months after
the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 and after opportunity for comment, the Administrator
shall publish a schedule establishing a date for the promulga-
tion of emission standards for each category and subcategory
of sources listed pursuant to subsection (c)(1) and (3) which
shall be consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (1)
and (2). The determination of priorities for the promulgation of
standards pursuant to this paragraph is not a rulemaking and

shall not be subject to judicial review, except that, failure to
promulgate any standard pursuant to the schedule established
by this paragraph shall be subject to review under section 304
of this Act.
(4) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—Notwithstanding section 307 of this
Act, no action of the Administrator adding a pollutant to the
list under subsection (b) or listing a source category or sub-
category under subsection (c) shall be a final agency action
subject to judicial review, except that any such action may be
reviewed under such section 307 when the Administrator
issues emission standards for such pollutant or category.
(5) PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS.—The Adminis-
trator shall promulgate standards pursuant to subsection (d)
applicable to publicly owned treatment works (as defined in
title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act) not later
than 5 years after the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990.
(f) STANDARD TO PROTECT HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT.—
(1) REPORT.—Not later than 6 years after the date of en-
actment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 the Admin-
istrator shall investigate and report, after consultation with
the Surgeon General and after opportunity for public comment,
to Congress on—
(A) methods of calculating the risk to public health re-
maining, or likely to remain, from sources subject to regu-
lation under this section after the application of standards
under subsection (d);
(B) the public health significance of such estimated re-
maining risk and the technologically and commercially
available methods and costs of reducing such risks;
(C) the actual health effects with respect to persons
living in the vicinity of sources, any available epidemiolog-
ical or other health studies, risks presented by background
concentrations of hazardous air pollutants, any uncertain-
ties in risk assessment methodology or other health as-
sessment technique, and any negative health or environ-
mental consequences to the community of efforts to reduce
such risks; and
(D) recommendations as to legislation regarding such
remaining risk.
(2) EMISSION STANDARDS.—
(A) If Congress does not act on any recommendation
submitted under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall,
within 8 years after promulgation of standards for each
category or subcategory of sources pursuant to subsection
(d), promulgate standards for such category or subcategory
if promulgation of such standards is required in order to
provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health
in accordance with this section (as in effect before the date
of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) or
to prevent, taking into consideration costs, energy, safety,
and other relevant factors, an adverse environmental ef-
fect. Emission standards promulgated under this sub-
section shall provide an ample margin of safety to protect

before the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990), unless the Administrator determines that
a more stringent standard is necessary to prevent, taking
into consideration costs, energy, safety, and other relevant
factors, an adverse environmental effect. If standards pro-
mulgated pursuant to subsection (d) and applicable to a
category or subcategory of sources emitting a pollutant (or
pollutants) classified as a known, probable or possible
human carcinogen do not reduce lifetime excess cancer
risks to the individual most exposed to emissions from a
source in the category or subcategory to less than one in
one million, the Administrator shall promulgate standards
under this subsection for such source category.
(B) Nothing in subparagraph (A) or in any other provi-
sion of this section shall be construed as affecting, or ap-
plying to the Administrator’s interpretation of this section,
as in effect before the date of enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 and set forth in the Federal Reg-
ister of September 14, 1989 (54 Federal Register 38044).
(C) The Administrator shall determine whether or not
to promulgate such standards and, if the Administrator de-
cides to promulgate such standards, shall promulgate the
standards 8 years after promulgation of the standards
under subsection (d) for each source category or sub-
category concerned. In the case of categories or subcat-
egories for which standards under subsection (d) are re-
quired to be promulgated within 2 years after the date of
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the
Administrator shall have 9 years after promulgation of the
standards under subsection (d) to make the determination
under the preceding sentence and, if required, to promul-
gate the standards under this paragraph.
(3) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Any emission standard established
pursuant to this subsection shall become effective upon pro-
mulgation.
(4) PROHIBITION.—No air pollutant to which a standard
under this subsection applies may be emitted from any sta-
tionary source in violation of such standard, except that in the
case of an existing source—
(A) such standard shall not apply until 90 days after
its effective date, and
(B) the Administrator may grant a waiver permitting
such source a period of up to 2 years after the effective
date of a standard to comply with the standard if the Ad-
ministrator finds that such period is necessary for the in-
stallation of controls and that steps will be taken during
the period of the waiver to assure that the health of per-
sons will be protected from imminent endangerment.
(5) AREA SOURCES.—The Administrator shall not be re-
quired to conduct any review under this subsection or promul-
gate emission limitations under this subsection for any cat-
egory or subcategory of area sources that is listed pursuant to

subsection (c)(3) and for which an emission standard is promul-
gated pursuant to subsection (d)(5).
(6) UNIQUE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES.—In establishing stand-
ards for the control of unique chemical substances of listed pol-
lutants without CAS numbers under this subsection, the Ad-
ministrator shall establish such standards with respect to the
health and environmental effects of the substances actually
emitted by sources and direct transformation byproducts of
such emissions in the categories and subcategories.
(g) MODIFICATIONS.—
(1) OFFSETS.—
(A) A physical change in, or change in the method of
operation of, a major source which results in a greater
than de minimis increase in actual emissions of a haz-
ardous air pollutant shall not be considered a modification,
if such increase in the quantity of actual emissions of any
hazardous air pollutant from such source will be offset by
an equal or greater decrease in the quantity of emissions
of another hazardous air pollutant (or pollutants) from
such source which is deemed more hazardous, pursuant to
guidance issued by the Administrator under subparagraph
(B). The owner or operator of such source shall submit a
showing to the Administrator (or the State) that such in-
crease has been offset under the preceding sentence.
(B) The Administrator shall, after notice and oppor-
tunity for comment and not later than 18 months after the
date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, publish guidance with respect to implementation of
this subsection. Such guidance shall include an identifica-
tion, to the extent practicable, of the relative hazard to
human health resulting from emissions to the ambient air
of each of the pollutants listed under subsection (b) suffi-
cient to facilitate the offset showing authorized by sub-
paragraph (A). Such guidance shall not authorize offsets
between pollutants where the increased pollutant (or more
than one pollutant in a stream of pollutants) causes ad-
verse effects to human health for which no safety thresh-
old for exposure can be determined unless there are cor-
responding decreases in such types of pollutant(s).
(2) CONSTRUCTION, RECONSTRUCTION AND MODIFICA-
TIONS.— (A) After the effective date of a permit program under
title V in any State, no person may modify a major source
of hazardous air pollutants in such State, unless the Ad-
ministrator (or the State) determines that the maximum
achievable control technology emission limitation under
this section for existing sources will be met. Such deter-
mination shall be made on a case-by-case basis where no
applicable emissions limitations have been established by
the Administrator.
(B) After the effective date of a permit program under
title V in any State, no person may construct or recon-
struct any major source of hazardous air pollutants, unless
the Administrator (or the State) determines that the max-

imum achievable control technology emission limitation
under this section for new sources will be met. Such deter-
mination shall be made on a case-by-case basis where no
applicable emission limitations have been established by
the Administrator.
(3) PROCEDURES FOR MODIFICATIONS.—The Administrator
(or the State) shall establish reasonable procedures for assur-
ing that the requirements applying to modifications under this
section are reflected in the permit.
(h) W ORK PRACTICE STANDARDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this section, if it is not
feasible in the judgment of the Administrator to prescribe or
enforce an emission standard for control of a hazardous air pol-
lutant or pollutants, the Administrator may, in lieu thereof,
promulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or operational
standard, or combination thereof, which in the Administrator’s
judgment is consistent with the provisions of subsection (d) or
(f). In the event the Administrator promulgates a design or
equipment standard under this subsection, the Administrator
shall include as part of such standard such requirements as
will assure the proper operation and maintenance of any such
element of design or equipment.
(2) DEFINITION.—For the purpose of this subsection, the
phrase ‘‘not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission stand-
ard’’ means any situation in which the Administrator deter-
mines that—
(A) a hazardous air pollutant or pollutants cannot be
emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to
emit or capture such pollutant, or that any requirement
for, or use of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent
with any Federal, State or local law, or
(B) the application of measurement methodology to a
particular class of sources is not practicable due to techno-
logical and economic limitations.
(3) ALTERNATIVE STANDARD.—If after notice and oppor-
tunity for comment, the owner or operator of any source estab-
lishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an alter-
native means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in
emissions of any air pollutant at least equivalent to the reduc-
tion in emissions of such pollutant achieved under the require-
ments of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall permit the use
of such alternative by the source for purposes of compliance
with this section with respect to such pollutant.
(4) NUMERICAL STANDARD REQUIRED.—Any standard pro-
mulgated under paragraph (1) shall be promulgated in terms
of an emission standard whenever it is feasible to promulgate
and enforce a standard in such terms.
(i) S CHEDULE FOR COMPLIANCE.—
(1) PRECONSTRUCTION AND OPERATING REQUIREMENTS.—
After the effective date of any emission standard, limitation, or
regulation under subsection (d), (f) or (h), no person may con-
struct any new major source or reconstruct any existing major
source subject to such emission standard, regulation or limita-
tion unless the Administrator (or a State with a permit pro-

gram approved under title V) determines that such source, if
properly constructed, reconstructed and operated, will comply
with the standard, regulation or limitation.
(2) SPECIAL RULE.—Notwithstanding the requirements of
paragraph (1), a new source which commences construction or
reconstruction after a standard, limitation or regulation appli-
cable to such source is proposed and before such standard, lim-
itation or regulation is promulgated shall not be required to
comply with such promulgated standard until the date 3 years
after the date of promulgation if—
(A) the promulgated standard, limitation or regulation
is more stringent than the standard, limitation or regula-
tion proposed; and
(B) the source complies with the standard, limitation,
or regulation as proposed during the 3-year period imme-
diately after promulgation.
(3) COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE FOR EXISTING SOURCES.—
(A) After the effective date of any emissions standard,
limitation or regulation promulgated under this section
and applicable to a source, no person may operate such
source in violation of such standard, limitation or regula-
tion except, in the case of an existing source, the Adminis-
trator shall establish a compliance date or dates for each
category or subcategory of existing sources, which shall
provide for compliance as expeditiously as practicable, but
in no event later than 3 years after the effective date of
such standard, except as provided in subparagraph (B) and
paragraphs (4) through (8).
(B) The Administrator (or a State with a program ap-
proved under title V) may issue a permit that grants an
extension permitting an existing source up to 1 additional
year to comply with standards under subsection (d) if such
additional period is necessary for the installation of con-
trols. An additional extension of up to 3 years may be
added for mining waste operations, if the 4-year compli-
ance time is insufficient to dry and cover mining waste in
order to reduce emissions of any pollutant listed under
subsection (b).
(4) PRESIDENTIAL EXEMPTION.—The President may exempt
any stationary source from compliance with any standard or
limitation under this section for a period of not more than 2
years if the President determines that the technology to imple-
ment such standard is not available and that it is in the na-
tional security interests of the United States to do so. An ex-
emption under this paragraph may be extended for 1 or more
additional periods, each period not to exceed 2 years. The
President shall report to Congress with respect to each exemp-
tion (or extension thereof) made under this paragraph.
(5) EARLY REDUCTION.—
(A) The Administrator (or a State acting pursuant to
a permit program approved under title V) shall issue a
permit allowing an existing source, for which the owner or
operator demonstrates that the source has achieved a re-
duction of 90 per centum or more in emissions of haz-

ardous air pollutants (95 per centum in the case of haz-
ardous air pollutants which are particulates) from the
source, to meet an alternative emission limitation reflect-
ing such reduction in lieu of an emission limitation pro-
mulgated under subsection (d) for a period of 6 years from
the compliance date for the otherwise applicable standard,
provided that such reduction is achieved before the other-
wise applicable standard under subsection (d) is first pro-
posed. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude a State
from requiring reductions in excess of those specified in
this subparagraph as a condition of granting the extension
authorized by the previous sentence.
(B) An existing source which achieves the reduction
referred to in subparagraph (A) after the proposal of an
applicable standard but before January 1, 1994, may qual-
ify under subparagraph (A), if the source makes an en-
forceable commitment to achieve such reduction before the
proposal of the standard. Such commitment shall be en-
forceable to the same extent as a regulation under this sec-
tion.(C) The reduction shall be determined with respect to
verifiable and actual emissions in a base year not earlier
than calendar year 1987, provided that, there is no evi-
dence that emissions in the base year are artificially or
substantially greater than emissions in other years prior
to implementation of emissions reduction measures. The
Administrator may allow a source to use a baseline year
of 1985 or 1986 provided that the source can demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Administrator that emissions
data for the source reflects verifiable data based on infor-
mation for such source, received by the Administrator
prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, pursuant to an information request issued under
section 114.
(D) For each source granted an alternative emission
limitation under this paragraph there shall be established
by a permit issued pursuant to title V an enforceable emis-
sion limitation for hazardous air pollutants reflecting the
reduction which qualifies the source for an alternative
emission limitation under this paragraph. An alternative
emission limitation under this paragraph shall not be
available with respect to standards or requirements pro-
mulgated pursuant to subsection (f) and the Administrator
shall, for the purpose of determining whether a standard
under subsection (f) is necessary, review emissions from
sources granted an alternative emission limitation under
this paragraph at the same time that other sources in the
category or subcategory are reviewed.
(E) With respect to pollutants for which high risks of
adverse public health effects may be associated with expo-
sure to small quantities including, but not limited to,
chlorinated dioxins and furans, the Administrator shall by
regulation limit the use of offsetting reductions in emis-
sions of other hazardous air pollutants from the source as

counting toward the 90 per centum reduction in such high-
risk pollutants qualifying for an alternative emissions limi-
tation under this paragraph.
(6) OTHER REDUCTIONS.—Notwithstanding the require-
ments of this section, no existing source that has installed—
(A) best available control technology (as defined in sec-
tion 169(3)), or
(B) technology required to meet a lowest achievable
emission rate (as defined in section 171),
prior to the promulgation of a standard under this section ap-
plicable to such source and the same pollutant (or stream of
pollutants) controlled pursuant to an action described in sub-
paragraph (A) or (B) shall be required to comply with such
standard under this section until the date 5 years after the
date on which such installation or reduction has been achieved,
as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator may
issue such rules and guidance as are necessary to implement
this paragraph.
(7) EXTENSION FOR NEW SOURCES.—A source for which con-
struction or reconstruction is commenced after the date an
emission standard applicable to such source is proposed pursu-
ant to subsection (d) but before the date an emission standard
applicable to such source is proposed pursuant to subsection (f)
shall not be required to comply with the emission standard
under subsection (f) until the date 10 years after the date con-
struction or reconstruction is commenced.
(8) COKE OVENS.
(A) Any coke oven battery that complies with the
emission limitations established under subsection (d)(8)(C),
subparagraph (B), and subparagraph (C), and complies
with the provisions of subparagraph (E), shall not be re-
quired to achieve emission limitations promulgated under
subsection (f) until January 1, 2020.
(B)(i) Not later than December 31, 1992, the Adminis-
trator shall promulgate emission limitations for coke oven
emissions from coke oven batteries. Notwithstanding para-
graph (3) of this subsection, the compliance date for such
emission limitations for existing coke oven batteries shall
be January 1, 1998. Such emission limitations shall reflect
the lowest achievable emission rate as defined in section
171 for a coke oven battery that is rebuilt or a replacement
at a coke oven plant for an existing battery. Such emission
limitations shall be no less stringent than—
(I) 3 per centum leaking doors (5 per centum leak-
ing doors for six meter batteries);
(II) 1 per centum leaking lids;
(III) 4 per centum leaking offtakes; and
(IV) 16 seconds visible emissions per charge,
with an exclusion for emissions during the period after the
closing of self-sealing oven doors (or the total mass emis-
sions equivalent). The rulemaking in which such emission
limitations are promulgated shall also establish an appro-
priate measurement methodology for determining compli-
ance with such emission limitations, and shall establish

such emission limitations in terms of an equivalent level
of mass emissions reduction from a coke oven battery, un-
less the Administrator finds that such a mass emissions
standard would not be practicable or enforceable. Such
measurement methodology, to the extent it measures leak-
ing doors, shall take into consideration alternative test
methods that reflect the best technology and practices ac-
tually applied in the affected industries, and shall assure
that the final test methods are consistent with the per-
formance of such best technology and practices.
(ii) If the Administrator fails to promulgate such emis-
sion limitations under this subparagraph prior to the effec-
tive date of such emission limitations, the emission limita-
tions applicable to coke oven batteries under this subpara-
graph shall be—
(I) 3 per centum leaking doors (5 per centum leak-
ing doors for six meter batteries);
(II) 1 per centum leaking lids;
(III) 4 per centum leaking offtakes; and
(IV) 16 seconds visible emissions per charge,
or the total mass emissions equivalent (if the total mass
emissions equivalent is determined to be practicable and
enforceable), with no exclusion for emissions during the pe-
riod after the closing of self-sealing oven doors.
(C) Not later than January 1, 2007, the Administrator
shall review the emission limitations promulgated under
subparagraph (B) and revise, as necessary, such emission
limitations to reflect the lowest achievable emission rate
as defined in section 171 at the time for a coke oven bat-
tery that is rebuilt or a replacement at a coke oven plant
for an existing battery. Such emission limitations shall be
no less stringent than the emission limitation promulgated
under subparagraph (B). Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of
this subsection, the compliance date for such emission lim-
itations for existing coke oven batteries shall be January
1, 2010.
(D) At any time prior to January 1, 1998, the owner
or operator of any coke oven battery may elect to comply
with emission limitations promulgated under subsection (f)
by the date such emission limitations would otherwise
apply to such coke oven battery, in lieu of the emission
limitations and the compliance dates provided under sub-
paragraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph. Any such owner
or operator shall be legally bound to comply with such
emission limitations promulgated under subsection (f) with
respect to such coke oven battery as of January 1, 2003.
If no such emission limitations have been promulgated for
such coke oven battery, the Administrator shall promul-
gate such emission limitations in accordance with sub-
section (f) for such coke oven battery.
(E) Coke oven batteries qualifying for an extension
under subparagraph (A) shall make available not later
than January 1, 2000, to the surrounding communities the
results of any risk assessment performed by the Adminis-

trator to determine the appropriate level of any emission
standard established by the Administrator pursuant to
subsection (f).
(F) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, re-
construction of any source of coke oven emissions quali-
fying for an extension under this paragraph shall not sub-
ject such source to emission limitations under subsection
(f) more stringent than those established under subpara-
graphs (B) and (C) until January 1, 2020. For the purposes
of this subparagraph, the term ‘‘reconstruction’’ includes
the replacement of existing coke oven battery capacity
with new coke oven batteries of comparable or lower capac-
ity and lower potential emissions.
(j) EQUIVALENT EMISSION LIMITATION BY PERMIT.—
(1) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The requirements of this subsection
shall apply in each State beginning on the effective date of a
permit program established pursuant to title V in such State,
but not prior to the date 42 months after the date of enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
(2) FAILURE TO PROMULGATE A STANDARD.—In the event
that the Administrator fails to promulgate a standard for a
category or subcategory of major sources by the date estab-
lished pursuant to subsection (e)(1) and (3), and beginning 18
months after such date (but not prior to the effective date of
a permit program under title V), the owner or operator of any
major source in such category or subcategory shall submit a
permit application under paragraph (3) and such owner or op-
erator shall also comply with paragraphs (5) and (6).
(3) APPLICATIONS.—By the date established by paragraph
(2), the owner or operator of a major source subject to this sub-
section shall file an application for a permit. If the owner or
operator of a source has submitted a timely and complete ap-
plication for a permit required by this subsection, any failure
to have a permit shall not be a violation of paragraph (2), un-
less the delay in final action is due to the failure of the appli-
cant to timely submit information required or requested to
process the application. The Administrator shall not later than
18 months after the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, and after notice and opportunity for com-
ment, establish requirements for applications under this sub-
section including a standard application form and criteria for
determining in a timely manner the completeness of applica-
tions.
(4) REVIEW AND APPROVAL.—Permit applications submitted
under this subsection shall be reviewed and approved or dis-
approved according to the provisions of section 505. In the
event that the Administrator (or the State) disapproves a per-
mit application submitted under this subsection or determines
that the application is incomplete, the applicant shall have up
to 6 months to revise the application to meet the objections of
the Administrator (or the State).
(5) EMISSION LIMITATION.—The permit shall be issued pur-
suant to title V and shall contain emission limitations for the
hazardous air pollutants subject to regulation under this sec-

tion and emitted by the source that the Administrator (or the
State) determines, on a case-by-case basis, to be equivalent to
the limitation that would apply to such source if an emission
standard had been promulgated in a timely manner under sub-
section (d). In the alternative, if the applicable criteria are met,
the permit may contain an emissions limitation established ac-
cording to the provisions of subsection (i)(5). For purposes of
the preceding sentence, the reduction required by subsection
(i)(5)(A) shall be achieved by the date on which the relevant
standard should have been promulgated under subsection (d).
No such pollutant may be emitted in amounts exceeding an
emission limitation contained in a permit immediately for new
sources and, as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than
the date 3 years after the permit is issued for existing sources
or such other compliance date as would apply under subsection
(i). (6) APPLICABILITY OF SUBSEQUENT STANDARDS.—If the Ad-
ministrator promulgates an emission standard that is applica-
ble to the major source prior to the date on which a permit ap-
plication is approved, the emission limitation in the permit
shall reflect the promulgated standard rather than the emis-
sion limitation determined pursuant to paragraph (5), provided
that the source shall have the compliance period provided
under subsection (i). If the Administrator promulgates a stand-
ard under subsection (d) that would be applicable to the source
in lieu of the emission limitation established by permit under
this subsection after the date on which the permit has been
issued, the Administrator (or the State) shall revise such per-
mit upon the next renewal to reflect the standard promulgated
by the Administrator providing such source a reasonable time
to comply, but no longer than 8 years after such standard is
promulgated or 8 years after the date on which the source is
first required to comply with the emissions limitation estab-
lished by paragraph (5), whichever is earlier.
(k) AREA SOURCE PROGRAM.—
(1) FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.—The Congress finds that emis-
sions of hazardous air pollutants from area sources may indi-
vidually, or in the aggregate, present significant risks to public
health in urban areas. Considering the large number of per-
sons exposed and the risks of carcinogenic and other adverse
health effects from hazardous air pollutants, ambient con-
centrations characteristic of large urban areas should be re-
duced to levels substantially below those currently experienced.
It is the purpose of this subsection to achieve a substantial re-
duction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants from area
sources and an equivalent reduction in the public health risks
associated with such sources including a reduction of not less
than 75 per centum in the incidence of cancer attributable to
emissions from such sources.
(2) RESEARCH PROGRAM.—The Administrator shall, after
consultation with State and local air pollution control officials,
conduct a program of research with respect to sources of haz-
ardous air pollutants in urban areas and shall include within
such program—

(A) ambient monitoring for a broad range of hazardous
air pollutants (including, but not limited to, volatile or-
ganic compounds, metals, pesticides and products of in-
complete combustion) in a representative number of urban
locations;
(B) analysis to characterize the sources of such pollu-
tion with a focus on area sources and the contribution that
such sources make to public health risks from hazardous
air pollutants; and
(C) consideration of atmospheric transformation and
other factors which can elevate public health risks from
such pollutants.
Health effects considered under this program shall include, but
not be limited to, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity,
neurotoxicity, reproductive dysfunction and other acute and
chronic effects including the role of such pollutants as precur-
sors of ozone or acid aerosol formation. The Administrator
shall report the preliminary results of such research not later
than 3 years after the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990.
(3) NATIONAL STRATEGY.—
(A) Considering information collected pursuant to the
monitoring program authorized by paragraph (2), the Ad-
ministrator shall, not later than 5 years after the date of
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and
after notice and opportunity for public comment, prepare
and transmit to the Congress a comprehensive strategy to
control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from area
sources in urban areas.
(B) The strategy shall—
(i) identify not less than 30 hazardous air pollut-
ants which, as the result of emissions from area
sources, present the greatest threat to public health in
the largest number of urban areas and that are or will
be listed pursuant to subsection (b), and
(ii) identify the source categories or subcategories
emitting such pollutants that are or will be listed pur-
suant to subsection (c). When identifying categories
and subcategories of sources under this subparagraph,
the Administrator shall assure that sources accounting
for 90 per centum or more of the aggregate emissions
of each of the 30 identified hazardous air pollutants
are subject to standards pursuant to subsection (d).
(C) The strategy shall include a schedule of specific ac-
tions to substantially reduce the public health risks posed
by the release of hazardous air pollutants from area
sources that will be implemented by the Administrator
under the authority of this or other laws (including, but
not limited to, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Fed-
eral Insecticide, Fungicide 27 and Rodenticide Act and the

preclude or delay implementation of actions with respect to
area sources of hazardous air pollutants under consider-
ation pursuant to this or any other law and that may be
promulgated before the strategy is prepared.
(F) The Administrator shall implement the strategy as
expeditiously as practicable assuring that all sources are
in compliance with all requirements not later than 9 years
after the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990.
(G) As part of such strategy the Administrator shall
provide for ambient monitoring and emissions modeling in
urban areas as appropriate to demonstrate that the goals
and objectives of the strategy are being met.
(4) AREAWIDE ACTIVITIES.—In addition to the national
urban air toxics strategy authorized by paragraph (3), the Ad-
ministrator shall also encourage and support areawide strate-
gies developed by State or local air pollution control agencies
that are intended to reduce risks from emissions by area
sources within a particular urban area. From the funds avail-
able for grants under this section, the Administrator shall set
aside not less than 10 per centum to support areawide strate-
gies addressing hazardous air pollutants emitted by area
sources and shall award such funds on a demonstration basis
to those States with innovative and effective strategies. At the
request of State or local air pollution control officials, the Ad-
ministrator shall prepare guidelines for control technologies or
management practices which may be applicable to various cat-
egories or subcategories of area sources.
(5) REPORT.—The Administrator shall report to the Con-
gress at intervals not later than 8 and 12 years after the date
of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 on ac-
tions taken under this subsection and other parts of this Act
to reduce the risk to public health posed by the release of haz-
ardous air pollutants from area sources. The reports shall also
identify specific metropolitan areas that continue to experience
high risks to public health as the result of emissions from area

(1) IN GENERAL.—Each State may develop and submit to
the Administrator for approval a program for the implementa-
tion and enforcement (including a review of enforcement dele-
gations previously granted) of emission standards and other re-
quirements for air pollutants subject to this section or require-
ments for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases
pursuant to subsection (r). A program submitted by a State
under this subsection may provide for partial or complete dele-
gation of the Administrator’s authorities and responsibilities to
implement and enforce emissions standards and prevention re-
quirements but shall not include authority to set standards
less stringent than those promulgated by the Administrator
under this Act.
(2) GUIDANCE.—Not later than 12 months after the date of
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Ad-
ministrator shall publish guidance that would be useful to the
States in developing programs for submittal under this sub-
section. The guidance shall also provide for the registration of
all facilities producing, processing, handling or storing any sub-
stance listed pursuant to subsection (r) in amounts greater

tion of human health and the environment.
(6) ADDITIONAL REGULATION.—As part of the report to Con-
gress, the Administrator shall determine whether the other
provisions of this section are adequate to prevent serious ad-
verse effects to public health and serious or widespread envi-
ronmental effects, including such effects resulting from indirect
exposure pathways, associated with atmospheric deposition to
the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, Lake Champlain and
coastal waters of hazardous air pollutants (and their atmos-
pheric transformation products). The Administrator shall take
into consideration the tendency of such pollutants to bio-
accumulate. Within 5 years after the date of enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall,
based on such report and determination, promulgate, in accord-
ance with this section, such further emission standards or con-
trol measures as may be necessary and appropriate to prevent
such effects, including effects due to bioaccumulation and indi-
rect exposure pathways. Any requirements promulgated pursu-
ant to this paragraph with respect to coastal waters shall only
apply to the coastal waters of the States which are subject to
section 328(a).

technologies which have the potential to significantly re-
duce emissions of hazardous air pollutants from coke oven
production facilities. In identifying control technologies,
the Secretary and the Administrator shall consider the
range of existing coke oven operations and battery design
and the availability of sources of materials for such coke
ovens as well as alternatives to existing coke oven produc-
tion design.
(B) The Secretary and the Administrator are author-
ized to enter into agreements with persons who propose to
develop, install and operate coke production emission con-
trol technologies which have the potential for significant
emissions reductions of hazardous air pollutants provided
that Federal funds shall not exceed 50 per centum of the
cost of any project assisted pursuant to this paragraph.
(C) The Secretary shall prepare annual reports to Con-
gress on the status of the research program and at the
completion of the study shall make recommendations to
the Administrator identifying practicable and economically
viable control technologies for coke oven production facili-
ties to reduce residual risks remaining after implementa-
tion of the standard under subsection (d).

under such Amendments. Except as provided in paragraph (4),
any standard under this section which has been promulgated,
but has not taken effect, before such date shall not be affected
by such Amendments unless modified as provided in this sec-
tion before such date or under such Amendments. Each such
standard shall be reviewed and, if appropriate, revised, to com-
ply with the requirements of subsection (d) within 10 years
after the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. If a timely petition for review of any such standard
under section 307 is pending on such date of enactment, the
standard shall be upheld if it complies with this section as in
effect before that date. If any such standard is remanded to the
Administrator, the Administrator may in the Administrator’s
discretion apply either the requirements of this section, or
those of this section as in effect before the date of enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
(2) SPECIAL RULE.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), no
standard shall be established under this section, as amended
by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, for radionuclide
emissions from (A) elemental phosphorous plants, (B) grate cal-
cination elemental phosphorous plants, (C) phosphogypsum
stacks, or (D) any subcategory of the foregoing. This section, as
in effect prior to the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, shall remain in effect for radionuclide
emissions from such plants and stacks.
(3) OTHER CATEGORIES.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1),
this section, as in effect prior to the date of enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, shall remain in effect for
radionuclide emissions from non-Department of Energy Fed-
eral facilities that are not licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, coal-fired utility and industrial boilers, under-
ground uranium mines, surface uranium mines, and disposal of
uranium mill tailings piles, unless the Administrator, in the
Administrator’s discretion, applies the requirements of this sec-
tion as modified by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to
such sources of radionuclides.
(4) MEDICAL FACILITIES.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1),
no standard promulgated under this section prior to the date
of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 with
respect to medical research or treatment facilities shall take ef-
fect for two years following the date of enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, unless the Administrator makes
a determination pursuant to a rulemaking under section
112(d)(9). If the Administrator determines that the regulatory
program established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
for such facilities does not provide an ample margin of safety
to protect public health, the requirements of section 112 shall
fully apply to such facilities. If the Administrator determines
that such regulatory program does provide an ample margin of
safety to protect the public health, the Administrator is not re-
quired to promulgate a standard under this section for such fa-
cilities, as provided in section 112(d)(9).

30 So in original. Reference should be to section 5 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act
of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 654).
(1) PURPOSE AND GENERAL DUTY.—It shall be the objective
of the regulations and programs authorized under this sub-
section to prevent the accidental release and to minimize the
consequences of any such release of any substance listed pur-
suant to paragraph (3) or any other extremely hazardous sub-
stance. The owners and operators of stationary sources pro-
ducing, processing, handling or storing such substances have a
general duty in the same manner and to the same extent as
section 654, title 29 of the United States Code, 30 to identify
hazards which may result from such releases using appropriate
hazard assessment techniques, to design and maintain a safe
facility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases,
and to minimize the consequences of accidental releases which
do occur. For purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of sec-
tion 304 shall not be available to any person or otherwise be
construed to be applicable to this paragraph. Nothing in this
section shall be interpreted, construed, implied or applied to
create any liability or basis for suit for compensation for bodily
injury or any other injury or property damages to any person
which may result from accidental releases of such substances.
(2) DEFINITIONS.—
(A) The term ‘‘accidental release’’ means an unantici-
pated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely
hazardous substance into the ambient air from a sta-
tionary source.
(B) The term ‘‘regulated substance’’ means a substance
listed under paragraph (3).
(C) The term ‘‘stationary source’’ means any buildings,
structures, equipment, installations or substance emitting
stationary activities (i) which belong to the same industrial
group, (ii) which are located on one or more contiguous
properties, (iii) which are under the control of the same
person (or persons under common control), and (iv) from
which an accidental release may occur.
(D) The term ‘‘retail facility’’ means a stationary
source at which more than one-half of the income is ob-
tained from direct sales to end users or at which more
than one-half of the fuel sold, by volume, is sold through
a cylinder exchange program.
(3) LIST OF SUBSTANCES.—The Administrator shall promul-
gate not later than 24 months after enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 an initial list of 100 substances
which, in the case of an accidental release, are known to cause
or may reasonably be anticipated to cause death, injury, or se-
rious adverse effects to human health or the environment. For
purposes of promulgating such list, the Administrator shall
use, but is not limited to, the list of extremely hazardous sub-
stances published under the Emergency Planning and Commu-
nity Right-to-Know Act of 1986, with such modifications as the
Administrator deems appropriate. The initial list shall include
chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, methyl chloride, ethylene oxide,

vinyl chloride, methyl isocyanate, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia,
hydrogen sulfide, toluene diisocyanate, phosgene, bromine, an-
hydrous hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous sul-
fur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide. The initial list shall include at
least 100 substances which pose the greatest risk of causing
death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or the
environment from accidental releases. Regulations establishing
the list shall include an explanation of the basis for estab-
lishing the list. The list may be revised from time to time by
the Administrator on the Administrator’s own motion or by pe-
tition and shall be reviewed at least every 5 years. No air pol-
lutant for which a national primary ambient air quality stand-
ard has been established shall be included on any such list. No
substance, practice, process, or activity regulated under title VI
shall be subject to regulations under this subsection. The Ad-
ministrator shall establish procedures for the addition and de-
letion of substances from the list established under this para-
graph consistent with those applicable to the list in subsection
(b).
(4) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.—In listing substances
under paragraph (3), the Administrator—
(A) shall consider—
(i) the severity of any acute adverse health effects
associated with accidental releases of the substance;
(ii) the likelihood of accidental releases of the sub-
stance; and
(iii) the potential magnitude of human exposure to
accidental releases of the substance; and
(B) shall not list a flammable substance when used as
a fuel or held for sale as a fuel at a retail facility under
this subsection solely because of the explosive or flam-
mable properties of the substance, unless a fire or explo-
sion caused by the substance will result in acute adverse
health effects from human exposure to the substance, in-
cluding the unburned fuel or its combustion byproducts,
other than those caused by the heat of the fire or impact
of the explosion.
(5) THRESHOLD QUANTITY.—At the time any substance is
listed pursuant to paragraph (3), the Administrator shall es-
tablish by rule, a threshold quantity for the substance, taking
into account the toxicity, reactivity, volatility, dispersibility,
combustibility, or flammability of the substance and the
amount of the substance which, as a result of an accidental re-
lease, is known to cause or may reasonably be anticipated to
cause death, injury or serious adverse effects to human health
for which the substance was listed. The Administrator is au-
thorized to establish a greater threshold quantity for, or to ex-
empt entirely, any substance that is a nutrient used in agri-
culture when held by a farmer.
(6) CHEMICAL SAFETY BOARD.—
(A) There is hereby established an independent safety
board to be known as the Chemical Safety and Hazard In-
vestigation Board.

(B) The Board shall consist of 5 members, including a
Chairperson, who shall be appointed by the President, by
and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Members
of the Board shall be appointed on the basis of technical
qualification, professional standing, and demonstrated
knowledge in the fields of accident reconstruction, safety
engineering, human factors, toxicology, or air pollution
regulation. The terms of office of members of the Board
shall be 5 years. Any member of the Board, including the
Chairperson, may be removed for inefficiency, neglect of
duty, or malfeasance in office. The Chairperson shall be
the Chief Executive Officer of the Board and shall exercise
the executive and administrative functions of the Board.
(C) The Board shall—
(i) investigate (or cause to be investigated), deter-
mine and report to the public in writing the facts, con-
ditions, and circumstances and the cause or probable
cause of any accidental release resulting in a fatality,
serious injury or substantial property damages;
(ii) issue periodic reports to the Congress, Federal,
State and local agencies, including the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, concerned with the safety of
chemical production, processing, handling and storage,
and other interested persons recommending measures
to reduce the likelihood or the consequences of acci-
dental releases and proposing corrective steps to make
chemical production, processing, handling and storage
as safe and free from risk of injury as is possible and
may include in such reports proposed rules or orders
which should be issued by the Administrator under
the authority of this section or the Secretary of Labor
under the Occupational Safety and Health Act 31 to
prevent or minimize the consequences of any release of
substances that may cause death, injury or other seri-
ous adverse effects on human health or substantial
property damage as the result of an accidental release;
and (iii) establish by regulation requirements binding
on persons for reporting accidental releases into the
ambient air subject to the Board’s investigatory juris-
diction. Reporting releases to the National Response
Center, in lieu of the Board directly, shall satisfy such
regulations. The National Response Center shall
promptly notify the Board of any releases which are
within the Board’s jurisdiction.
(D) The Board may utilize the expertise and experi-
ence of other agencies.
(E) The Board shall coordinate its activities with in-
vestigations and studies conducted by other agencies of the
United States having a responsibility to protect public
health and safety. The Board shall enter into a memo-

randum of understanding with the National Transpor-
tation Safety Board to assure coordination of functions and
to limit duplication of activities which shall designate the
National Transportation Safety Board as the lead agency
for the investigation of releases which are transportation
related. The Board shall not be authorized to investigate
marine oil spills, which the National Transportation Safety
Board is authorized to investigate. The Board shall enter
into a memorandum of understanding with the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administration so as to limit du-
plication of activities. In no event shall the Board forego
an investigation where an accidental release causes a fa-
tality or serious injury among the general public, or had
the potential to cause substantial property damage or a
number of deaths or injuries among the general public.
(F) The Board is authorized to conduct research and
studies with respect to the potential for accidental re-
leases, whether or not an accidental release has occurred,
where there is evidence which indicates the presence of a
potential hazard or hazards. To the extent practicable, the
Board shall conduct such studies in cooperation with other
Federal agencies having emergency response authorities,
State and local governmental agencies and associations
and organizations from the industrial, commercial, and
nonprofit sectors.
(G) No part of the conclusions, findings, or rec-
ommendations of the Board relating to any accidental re-
lease or the investigation thereof shall be admitted as evi-
dence or used in any action or suit for damages arising out
of any matter mentioned in such report.
(H) Not later than 18 months after the date of enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Board
shall publish a report accompanied by recommendations to
the Administrator on the use of hazard assessments in
preventing the occurrence and minimizing the con-
sequences of accidental releases of extremely hazardous
substances. The recommendations shall include a list of
extremely hazardous substances which are not regulated
substances (including threshold quantities for such sub-
stances) and categories of stationary sources for which
hazard assessments would be an appropriate measure to
aid in the prevention of accidental releases and to mini-
mize the consequences of those releases that do occur. The
recommendations shall also include a description of the in-
formation and analysis which would be appropriate to in-
clude in any hazard assessment. The Board shall also
make recommendations with respect to the role of risk
management plans as required by paragraph (8)(B) 32 in
preventing accidental releases. The Board may from time
to time review and revise its recommendations under this
subparagraph.

(7) ACCIDENT PREVENTION.—
(A) In order to prevent accidental releases of regulated
substances, the Administrator is authorized to promulgate
release prevention, detection, and correction requirements
which may include monitoring, record-keeping, reporting,
training, vapor recovery, secondary containment, and other
design, equipment, work practice, and operational require-
ments. Regulations promulgated under this paragraph
may make distinctions between various types, classes, and
kinds of facilities, devices and systems taking into consid-
eration factors including, but not limited to, the size, loca-
tion, process, process controls, quantity of substances han-
dled, potency of substances, and response capabilities
present at any stationary source. Regulations promulgated
pursuant to this subparagraph shall have an effective
date, as determined by the Administrator, assuring compli-
ance as expeditiously as practicable.
(B)(i) Within 3 years after the date of enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator
shall promulgate reasonable regulations and appropriate
guidance to provide, to the greatest extent practicable, for
the prevention and detection of accidental releases of regu-
lated substances and for response to such releases by the
owners or operators of the sources of such releases. The
Administrator shall utilize the expertise of the Secretaries
of Transportation and Labor in promulgating such regula-
tions. As appropriate, such regulations shall cover the use,
operation, repair, replacement, and maintenance of equip-
ment to monitor, detect, inspect, and control such releases,
including training of persons in the use and maintenance
of such equipment and in the conduct of periodic inspec-
tions. The regulations shall include procedures and meas-
ures for emergency response after an accidental release of

a regulated substance in order to protect human health
and the environment. The regulations shall cover storage,
as well as operations. The regulations shall, as appro-
priate, recognize differences in size, operations, processes,
class and categories of sources and the voluntary actions
of such sources to prevent such releases and respond to
such releases. The regulations shall be applicable to a sta-
tionary source 3 years after the date of promulgation, or
3 years after the date on which a regulated substance
present at the source in more than threshold amounts is
first listed under paragraph (3), whichever is later.
(ii) The regulations under this subparagraph shall re-
quire the owner or operator of stationary sources at which
a regulated substance is present in more than a threshold
quantity to prepare and implement a risk management
plan to detect and prevent or minimize accidental releases
of such substances from the stationary source, and to pro-
vide a prompt emergency response to any such releases in
order to protect human health and the environment. Such
plan shall provide for compliance with the requirements of
this subsection and shall also include each of the following:
(I) a hazard assessment to assess the potential ef-
fects of an accidental release of any regulated sub-
stance. This assessment shall include an estimate of
potential release quantities and a determination of
downwind effects, including potential exposures to af-
fected populations. Such assessment shall include a
previous release history of the past 5 years, including
the size, concentration, and duration of releases, and
shall include an evaluation of worst case accidental re-
leases;
(II) a program for preventing accidental releases
of regulated substances, including safety precautions
and maintenance, monitoring and employee training
measures to be used at the source; and
(III) a response program providing for specific ac-
tions to be taken in response to an accidental release
of a regulated substance so as to protect human health

ing the public and local agencies responsible for re-
sponding to accidental releases, emergency health
care, and employee training measures.
At the time regulations are promulgated under this sub-
paragraph, the Administrator shall promulgate guidelines
to assist stationary sources in the preparation of risk man-
agement plans. The guidelines shall, to the extent prac-
ticable, include model risk management plans.
(iii) The owner or operator of each stationary source
covered by clause (ii) shall register a risk management
plan prepared under this subparagraph with the Adminis-
trator before the effective date of regulations under clause
(i) in such form and manner as the Administrator shall, by
rule, require. Plans prepared pursuant to this subpara-

tionary source is located, and to any local agency or entity
having responsibility for planning for or responding to ac-
cidental releases which may occur at such source, and
shall be available to the public under section 114(c). The
Administrator shall establish, by rule, an auditing system
to regularly review and, if necessary, require revision in
risk management plans to assure that the plans comply
with this subparagraph. Each such plan shall be updated
periodically as required by the Administrator, by rule.
(C) Any regulations promulgated pursuant to this sub-
section shall to the maximum extent practicable, con-
sistent with this subsection, be consistent with the rec-
ommendations and standards established by the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) or the American Soci-
ety of Testing Materials (ASTM). The Administrator shall
take into consideration the concerns of small business in
promulgating regulations under this subsection.
(D) In carrying out the authority of this paragraph,
the Administrator shall consult with the Secretary of
Labor and the Secretary of Transportation and shall co-
ordinate any requirements under this paragraph with any
requirements established for comparable purposes by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the De-
partment of Transportation. Nothing in this subsection
shall be interpreted, construed or applied to impose re-
quirements affecting, or to grant the Administrator, the
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, or any
other agency any authority to regulate (including require-
ments for hazard assessment), the accidental release of
radionuclides arising from the construction and operation
of facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion.(E) After the effective date of any regulation or re-
quirement imposed under this subsection, it shall be un-
lawful for any person to operate any stationary source sub-
ject to such regulation or requirement in violation of such
regulation or requirement. Each regulation or requirement
under this subsection shall for purposes of sections 113,
114, 116, 120, 304, and 307 and other enforcement provi-
sions of this Act, be treated as a standard in effect under
subsection (d).
(F) Notwithstanding the provisions of title V or this
section, no stationary source shall be required to apply for,
or operate pursuant to, a permit issued under such title
solely because such source is subject to regulations or re-
quirements under this subsection.

minimum—
(aa) the preliminary findings under sub-
clause (I);
(bb) the methods used to develop the find-
ings; and
(cc) an explanation of the activities ex-
pected to occur that could cause the findings
of the report under subclause (I) to be dif-
ferent than the preliminary findings.
(III) AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION.—Informa-
tion that is developed by the Attorney General or
requested by the Attorney General and received
from a covered stationary source for the purpose

paragraph including, but not limited to, issuing such or-
ders as may be necessary to protect human health. The
Administrator shall take action under section 303 rather
than this paragraph whenever the authority of such sec-
tion is adequate to protect human health and the environ-

review of release prevention, mitigation and response authori-
ties of the various Federal agencies and shall clarify and co-
ordinate agency responsibilities to assure the most effective
and efficient implementation of such authorities and to identify
any deficiencies in authority or resources which may exist. The
President may utilize the resources and solicit the rec-
ommendations of the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investiga-
tion Board in conducting such review. At the conclusion of such
review, but not later than 24 months after the date of enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the President
shall transmit a message to the Congress on the release pre-
vention, mitigation and response activities of the Federal Gov-
ernment making such recommendations for change in law as

SEC. 113. FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—
(1) ORDER TO COMPLY WITH SIP.—Whenever, on the basis
of any information available to the Administrator, the Admin-
istrator finds that any person has violated or is in violation of
any requirement or prohibition of an applicable implementa-
tion plan or permit, the Administrator shall notify the person
and the State in which the plan applies of such finding. At any
time after the expiration of 30 days following the date on
which such notice of a violation is issued, the Administrator
may, without regard to the period of violation (subject to sec-
tion 2462 of title 28 of the United States Code)—
(A) issue an order requiring such person to comply
with the requirements or prohibitions of such plan or per-
mit, (B) issue an administrative penalty order in accord-
ance with subsection (d), or
(C) bring a civil action in accordance with subsection
(b).
(2) STATE FAILURE TO ENFORCE SIP OR PERMIT PROGRAM.—
Whenever, on the basis of information available to the Admin-
istrator, the Administrator finds that violations of an applica-
ble implementation plan or an approved permit program under
title V are so widespread that such violations appear to result
from a failure of the State in which the plan or permit program
applies to enforce the plan or permit program effectively, the
Administrator shall so notify the State. In the case of a permit
program, the notice shall be made in accordance with title V.
If the Administrator finds such failure extends beyond the 30th
day after such notice (90 days in the case of such permit pro-
gram), the Administrator shall give public notice of such find-
ing. During the period beginning with such public notice and
ending when such State satisfies the Administrator that it will
enforce such plan or permit program (hereafter referred to in
this section as ‘‘period of federally assumed enforcement’’), the
Administrator may enforce any requirement or prohibition of
such plan or permit program with respect to any person by—
(A) issuing an order requiring such person to comply
with such requirement or prohibition,

(B) issuing an administrative penalty order in accord-
ance with subsection (d), or
(C) bringing a civil action in accordance with sub-
section (b).
(3) EPA ENFORCEMENT OF OTHER REQUIREMENTS.—Except
for a requirement or prohibition enforceable under the pre-
ceding provisions of this subsection, whenever, on the basis of
any information available to the Administrator, the Adminis-
trator finds that any person has violated, or is in violation of,
any other requirement or prohibition of this title, section 303
of title III, title IV, title V, or title VI, including, but not lim-
ited to, a requirement or prohibition of any rule, plan, order,
waiver, or permit promulgated, issued, or approved under
those provisions or titles, or for the payment of any fee owed
to the United States under this Act (other than title II), the
Administrator may—
(A) issue an administrative penalty order in accord-
ance with subsection (d),
(B) issue an order requiring such person to comply
with such requirement or prohibition,
(C) bring a civil action in accordance with subsection
(b) or section 305, or
(D) request the Attorney General to commence a crimi-
nal action in accordance with subsection (c).
(4) REQUIREMENTS FOR ORDERS.—An order issued under
this subsection (other than an order relating to a violation of
section 112) shall not take effect until the person to whom it
is issued has had an opportunity to confer with the Adminis-
trator concerning the alleged violation. A copy of any order
issued under this subsection shall be sent to the State air pol-
lution control agency of any State in which the violation oc-
curs. Any order issued under this subsection shall state with
reasonable specificity the nature of the violation and specify a
time for compliance which the Administrator determines is
reasonable, taking into account the seriousness of the violation
and any good faith efforts to comply with applicable require-
ments. In any case in which an order under this subsection (or
notice to a violator under paragraph (1)) is issued to a corpora-
tion, a copy of such order (or notice) shall be issued to appro-
priate corporate officers. An order issued under this subsection
shall require the person to whom it was issued to comply with
the requirement as expeditiously as practicable, but in no
event longer than one year after the date the order was issued,
and shall be nonrenewable. No order issued under this sub-
section shall prevent the State or the Administrator from as-
sessing any penalties nor otherwise affect or limit the State’s
or the United States authority to enforce under other provi-
sions of this Act, nor affect any person’s obligations to comply
with any section of this Act or with a term or condition of any
permit or applicable implementation plan promulgated or ap-
proved under this Act.
(5) FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH NEW SOURCE REQUIRE-

ance with any requirement or prohibition of the Act relating to
the construction of new sources or the modification of existing
sources, the Administrator may—
(A) issue an order prohibiting the construction or
modification of any major stationary source in any area to
which such requirement applies;
(B) issue an administrative penalty order in accord-
ance with subsection (d), or
(C) bring a civil action under subsection (b).
Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the United States from
commencing a criminal action under section 113(c) at any time for
any such violation.
(b) CIVIL JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT.—The Administrator shall,
as appropriate, in the case of any person that is the owner or oper-
ator of an affected source, a major emitting facility, or a major sta-
tionary source, and may, in the case of any other person, commence
a civil action for a permanent or temporary injunction, or to assess
and recover a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day for
each violation, or both, in any of the following instances:
(1) Whenever such person has violated, or is in violation
of, any requirement or prohibition of an applicable implemen-
tation plan or permit. Such an action shall be commenced (A)
during any period of federally assumed enforcement, or (B)
more than 30 days following the date of the Administrator’s
notification under subsection (a)(1) that such person has vio-
lated, or is in violation of, such requirement or prohibition.
(2) Whenever such person has violated, or is in violation
of, any other requirement or prohibition of this title, section
303 of title III, title IV, title V, or title VI, including, but not
limited to, a requirement or prohibition of any rule, order,
waiver or permit promulgated, issued, or approved under this
Act, or for the payment of any fee owed the United States
under this Act (other than title II).
(3) Whenever such person attempts to construct or modify
a major stationary source in any area with respect to which a
finding under subsection (a)(5) has been made.
Any action under this subsection may be brought in the district
court of the United States for the district in which the violation is
alleged to have occurred, or is occurring, or in which the defendant
resides, or where the defendant’s principal place of business is lo-
cated, and such court shall have jurisdiction to restrain such viola-
tion, to require compliance, to assess such civil penalty, to collect
any fees owed the United States under this Act (other than title
II) and any noncompliance assessment and nonpayment penalty
owed under section 120, and to award any other appropriate relief.
Notice of the commencement of such action shall be given to the
appropriate State air pollution control agency. In the case of any
action brought by the Administrator under this subsection, the
court may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney
and expert witness fees) to the party or parties against whom such
action was brought if the court finds that such action was unrea-
sonable.

ing any requirement for the payment of any fee owed the United
States under this Act (other than title II) shall, upon conviction, be
punished by a fine pursuant to title 18 of the United States Code,
or by imprisonment for not to exceed 5 years, or both. If a convic-
tion of any person under this paragraph is for a violation com-
mitted after a first conviction of such person under this paragraph,
the maximum punishment shall be doubled with respect to both
the fine and imprisonment.
(2) Any person who knowingly—
(A) makes any false material statement, representation, or
certification in, or omits material information from, or know-
ingly alters, conceals, or fails to file or maintain any notice, ap-
plication, record, report, plan, or other document required pur-
suant to this Act to be either filed or maintained (whether with
respect to the requirements imposed by the Administrator or
by a State);
(B) fails to notify or report as required under this Act; or
(C) falsifies, tampers with, renders inaccurate, or fails to
install any monitoring device or method required to be main-
tained or followed under this Act 36
shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine pursuant to title 18
of the United States Code, or by imprisonment for not more than
2 years, or both. If a conviction of any person under this paragraph
is for a violation committed after a first conviction of such person
under this paragraph, the maximum punishment shall be doubled
with respect to both the fine and imprisonment.
(3) Any person who knowingly fails to pay any fee owed the
United States under this title, title III, IV, V, or VI shall, upon con-
viction, be punished by a fine pursuant to title 18 of the United
States Code, or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.

Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11002(a)(2)) that is not listed in section 112
of this Act, and who at the time negligently places another person
in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine under title 18 of the United
States Code, or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.
If a conviction of any person under this paragraph is for a violation
committed after a first conviction of such person under this para-
graph, the maximum punishment shall be doubled with respect to
both the fine and imprisonment.
(5)(A) Any person who knowingly releases into the ambient air
any hazardous air pollutant listed pursuant to section 112 of this
Act or any extremely hazardous substance listed pursuant to sec-
tion 302(a)(2) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11002(a)(2)) that is not listed in section 112
of this Act, and who knows at the time that he thereby places an-
other person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury
shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine under title 18 of the
United States Code, or by imprisonment of not more than 15 years,
or both. Any person committing such violation which is an organi-
zation shall, upon conviction under this paragraph, be subject to a
fine of not more than $1,000,000 for each violation. If a conviction
of any person under this paragraph is for a violation committed
after a first conviction of such person under this paragraph, the
maximum punishment shall be doubled with respect to both the
fine and imprisonment. For any air pollutant for which the Admin-
istrator has set an emissions standard or for any source for which
a permit has been issued under title V, a release of such pollutant
in accordance with that standard or permit shall not constitute a
violation of this paragraph or paragraph (4).
(B) In determining whether a defendant who is an individual
knew that the violation placed another person in imminent danger
of death or serious bodily injury—
(i) the defendant is responsible only for actual awareness
or actual belief possessed; and
(ii) knowledge possessed by a person other than the de-
fendant, but not by the defendant, may not be attributed to the
defendant;
except that in proving a defendant’s possession of actual knowl-
edge, circumstantial evidence may be used, including evidence that
the defendant took affirmative steps to be shielded from relevant
information.
(C) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution that the con-
duct charged was freely consented to by the person endangered and
that the danger and conduct charged were reasonably foreseeable
hazards of—
(i) an occupation, a business, or a profession; or
(ii) medical treatment or medical or scientific experimen-
tation conducted by professionally approved methods and such
other person had been made aware of the risks involved prior
to giving consent.
The defendant may establish an affirmative defense under this
subparagraph by a preponderance of the evidence.

(D) All general defenses, affirmative defenses, and bars to pros-
ecution that may apply with respect to other Federal criminal of-
fenses may apply under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and
shall be determined by the courts of the United States according
to the principles of common law as they may be interpreted in the
light of reason and experience. Concepts of justification and excuse
applicable under this section may be developed in the light of rea-
son and experience.
(E) The term ‘‘organization’’ means a legal entity, other than
a government, established or organized for any purpose, and such
term includes a corporation, company, association, firm, partner-
ship, joint stock company, foundation, institution, trust, society,
union, or any other association of persons.
(F) The term ‘‘serious bodily injury’’ means bodily injury which
involves a substantial risk of death, unconsciousness, extreme
physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement or protracted
loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or
mental faculty.
(6) For the purpose of this subsection, the term ‘‘person’’ in-
cludes, in addition to the entities referred to in section 302(e), any
responsible corporate officer.
(d) ADMINISTRATIVE ASSESSMENT OF CIVIL PENALTIES.—(1) The
Administrator may issue an administrative order against any per-
son assessing a civil administrative penalty of up to $25,000, per
day of violation, whenever, on the basis of any available informa-
tion, the Administrator finds that such person—
(A) has violated or is violating any requirement or prohibi-
tion of an applicable implementation plan (such order shall be
issued (i) during any period of federally assumed enforcement,
or (ii) more than thirty days following the date of the Adminis-
trator’s notification under subsection (a)(1) of this section of a
finding that such person has violated or is violating such re-
quirement or prohibition); or
(B) has violated or is violating any other requirement or
prohibition of title I, III, IV, V, or VI, including, but not limited
to, a requirement or prohibition of any rule, order, waiver, per-
mit, or plan promulgated, issued, or approved under this Act,
or for the payment of any fee owed the United States under
this Act (other than title II); or
(C) attempts to construct or modify a major stationary
source in any area with respect to which a finding under sub-
section (a)(5) of this section has been made.
The Administrator’s authority under this paragraph shall be lim-
ited to matters where the total penalty sought does not exceed
$200,000 and the first alleged date of violation occurred no more
than 12 months prior to the initiation of the administrative action,
except where the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly
determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount or
longer period of violation is appropriate for administrative penalty
action. Any such determination by the Administrator and the At-
torney General shall not be subject to judicial review.
(2)(A) An administrative penalty assessed under paragraph (1)
shall be assessed by the Administrator by an order made after op-
portunity for a hearing on the record in accordance with sections

554 and 556 of title 5 of the United States Code. The Administrator
shall issue reasonable rules for discovery and other procedures for
hearings under this paragraph. Before issuing such an order, the
Administrator shall give written notice to the person to be assessed
an administrative penalty of the Administrator’s proposal to issue
such order and provide such person an opportunity to request such
a hearing on the order, within 30 days of the date the notice is re-
ceived by such person.
(B) The Administrator may compromise, modify, or remit, with
or without conditions, any administrative penalty which may be
imposed under this subsection.
(3) The Administrator may implement, after consultation with
the Attorney General and the States, a field citation program
through regulations establishing appropriate minor violations for
which field citations assessing civil penalties not to exceed $5,000
per day of violation may be issued by officers or employees des-
ignated by the Administrator. Any person to whom a field citation
is assessed may, within a reasonable time as prescribed by the Ad-
ministrator through regulation, elect to pay the penalty assessment
or to request a hearing on the field citation. If a request for a hear-
ing is not made within the time specified in the regulation, the
penalty assessment in the field citation shall be final. Such hearing
shall not be subject to section 554 or 556 of title 5 of the United
States Code, but shall provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard
and to present evidence. Payment of a civil penalty required by a
field citation shall not be a defense to further enforcement by the
United States or a State to correct a violation, or to assess the stat-
utory maximum penalty pursuant to other authorities in the Act,
if the violation continues.
(4) Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under
paragraph (3) of this subsection or to whom an administrative pen-
alty order is issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection may
seek review of such assessment in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the viola-
tion is alleged to have occurred, in which such person resides, or
where such person’s principal place of business is located, by filing
in such court within 30 days following the date the administrative
penalty order becomes final under paragraph (2), the assessment
becomes final under paragraph (3), or a final decision following a
hearing under paragraph (3) is rendered, and by simultaneously
sending a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator
and the Attorney General. Within 30 days thereafter, the Adminis-
trator shall file in such court a certified copy, or certified index, as
appropriate, of the record on which the administrative penalty
order or assessment was issued. Such court shall not set aside or
remand such order or assessment unless there is not substantial
evidence in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of
a violation or unless the order or penalty assessment constitutes an
abuse of discretion. Such order or penalty assessment shall not be
subject to review by any court except as provided in this para-
graph. In any such proceedings, the United States may seek to re-
cover civil penalties ordered or assessed under this section.
(5) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty
or fails to comply with an administrative penalty order—

(A) after the order or assessment has become final, or
(B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (4)
has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator,
the Administrator shall request the Attorney General to bring a
civil action in an appropriate district court to enforce the order or
to recover the amount ordered or assessed (plus interest at rates
established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 from the date of the final order or decision or the date
of the final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the
validity, amount, and appropriateness of such order or assessment
shall not be subject to review. Any person who fails to pay on a
timely basis a civil penalty ordered or assessed under this section
shall be required to pay, in addition to such penalty and interest,
the United States enforcement expenses, including but not limited
to attorneys fees and costs incurred by the United States for collec-
tion proceedings and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each
quarter during which such failure to pay persists. Such non-
payment penalty shall be 10 percent of the aggregate amount of
such person’s outstanding penalties and nonpayment penalties ac-
crued as of the beginning of such quarter.
(e) PENALTY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA.—(1) In determining the
amount of any penalty to be assessed under this section or section
304(a), the Administrator or the court, as appropriate, shall take
into consideration (in addition to such other factors as justice may
require) the size of the business, the economic impact of the pen-
alty on the business, the violator’s full compliance history and good
faith efforts to comply, the duration of the violation as established
by any credible evidence (including evidence other than the appli-
cable test method), payment by the violator of penalties previously
assessed for the same violation, the economic benefit of noncompli-
ance, and the seriousness of the violation. The court shall not as-
sess penalties for noncompliance with administrative subpoenas
under section 307(a), or actions under section 114 of this Act,
where the violator had sufficient cause to violate or fail or refuse
to comply with such subpoena or action.
(2) A penalty may be assessed for each day of violation. For
purposes of determining the number of days of violation for which
a penalty may be assessed under subsection (b) or (d)(1) of this sec-
tion, or section 304(a), or an assessment may be made under sec-
tion 120, where the Administrator or an air pollution control agen-
cy has notified the source of the violation, and the plaintiff makes
a prima facie showing that the conduct or events giving rise to the
violation are likely to have continued or recurred past the date of
notice, the days of violation shall be presumed to include the date
of such notice and each and every day thereafter until the violator
establishes that continuous compliance has been achieved, except
to the extent that the violator can prove by a preponderance of the
evidence that there were intervening days during which no viola-
tion occurred or that the violation was not continuing in nature.
(f) A WARDS.—The Administrator may pay an award, not to ex-
ceed $10,000, to any person who furnishes information or services
which lead to a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative
civil penalty for any violation of this title or title III, IV, V, or VI
of this Act enforced under this section. Such payment is subject to

or any State or local government who furnishes information or ren-
ders service in the performance of an official duty is ineligible for

tion, prescribe additional criteria for eligibility for such an award.
(g) SETTLEMENTS; PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.—At least 30 days be-
fore a consent order or settlement agreement of any kind under
this Act to which the United States is a party (other than enforce-
ment actions under section 113, 120, or title II, whether or not in-
volving civil or criminal penalties, or judgments subject to Depart-
ment of Justice policy on public participation) is final or filed with
a court, the Administrator shall provide a reasonable opportunity
by notice in the Federal Register to persons who are not named as
parties or intervenors to the action or matter to comment in writ-
ing. The Administrator or the Attorney General, as appropriate,
shall promptly consider any such written comments and may with-
draw or withhold his consent to the proposed order or agreement
if the comments disclose facts or considerations which indicate that
such consent is inappropriate, improper, inadequate, or incon-
sistent with the requirements of this Act. Nothing in this sub-
section shall apply to civil or criminal penalties under this Act.
(h) OPERATOR.—For purposes of the provisions of this section
and section 120, the term ‘‘operator’’, as used in such provisions,
shall include any person who is senior management personnel or
a corporate officer. Except in the case of knowing and willful viola-
tions, such term shall not include any person who is a stationary
engineer or technician responsible for the operation, maintenance,
repair, or monitoring of equipment and facilities and who often has
supervisory and training duties but who is not senior management
personnel or a corporate officer. Except in the case of knowing and
willful violations, for purposes of subsection (c)(4) of this section,
the term ‘‘a person’’ shall not include an employee who is carrying
out his normal activities and who is not a part of senior manage-
ment personnel or a corporate officer. Except in the case of know-
ing and willful violations, for purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), (3),
and (5) of subsection (c) of this section the term ‘‘a person’’ shall
not include an employee who is carrying out his normal activities
and who is acting under orders from the employer.

(A) establish and maintain such records;
(B) make such reports;
(C) install, use, and maintain such monitoring equip-
ment, and use such audit procedures, or methods;
(D) sample such emissions (in accordance with such
procedures or methods, at such locations, at such intervals,
during such periods and in such manner as the Adminis-
trator shall prescribe);
(E) keep records on control equipment parameters,
production variables or other indirect data when direct
monitoring of emissions is impractical;
(F) submit compliance certifications in accordance with
section 114(a)(3); and
(G) provide such other information as the Adminis-

od required under paragraph (1), and sample any emis-
sions which such person is required to sample under para-

which is the owner or operator of a major stationary source,
and may, in the case of any other person, require enhanced
monitoring and submission of compliance certifications. Com-
pliance certifications shall include (A) identification of the ap-
plicable requirement that is the basis of the certification, (B)
the method used for determining the compliance status of the
source, (C) the compliance status, (D) whether compliance is
continuous or intermittent, (E) such other facts as the Admin-
istrator may require. Compliance certifications and monitoring
data shall be subject to subsection (c) of this section. Submis-
sion of a compliance certification shall in no way limit the Ad-
ministrator’s authorities to investigate or otherwise implement
this Act. The Administrator shall promulgate rules to provide
guidance and to implement this paragraph within 2 years after
the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

cable implementation plan or as part of an order under section
113(d), 38 before carrying out an entry, inspection, or monitoring
under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) with respect to such stand-
ard, limitation, or other requirement, the Administrator (or his rep-
resentatives) shall provide the State air pollution control agency
with reasonable prior notice of such action, indicating the purpose
of such action. No State agency which receives notice under this
paragraph of an action proposed to be taken may use the informa-
tion contained in the notice to inform the person whose property
is proposed to be affected of the proposed action. If the Adminis-
trator has reasonable basis for believing that a State agency is so
using or will so use such information, notice to the agency under
this paragraph is not required until such time as the Administrator
determines the agency will no longer so use information contained
in a notice under this paragraph. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to require notification to any State agency of any action
taken by the Administrator with respect to any standard, limita-
tion, or other requirement which is not part of an applicable imple-
mentation plan or which was promulgated by the Administrator
under section 110(c).
(2) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed to provide that
any failure of the Administrator to comply with the requirements
of such paragraph shall be a defense in any enforcement action
brought by the Administrator or shall make inadmissible as evi-
dence in any such action any information or material obtained not-
withstanding such failure to comply with such requirements.

INTERNATIONAL AIR POLLUTION
S EC. 115. (a) Whenever the Administrator, upon receipt of re-
ports, surveys or studies from any duly constituted international
agency has reason to believe that any air pollutant or pollutants
emitted in the United States cause or contribute to air pollution
which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or
welfare in a foreign country or whenever the Secretary of State re-
quests him to do so with respect to such pollution which the Sec-
retary of State alleges is of such a nature, the Administrator shall
give formal notification thereof to the Governor of the State in
which such emissions originate.
(b) The notice of the Administrator shall be deemed to be a
finding under section 110(a)(2)(H)(ii) which requires a plan revision
with respect to so much of the applicable implementation plan as
is inadequate to prevent or eliminate the endangerment referred to
in subsection (a). Any foreign country so affected by such emission
of pollutant or pollutants shall be invited to appear at any public
hearing associated with any revision of the appropriate portion of
the applicable implementation plan.
(c) This section shall apply only to a foreign country which the
Administrator determines has given the United States essentially
the same rights with respect to the prevention or control of air pol-
lution occurring in that country as is given that country by this
section.
(d) Recommendations issued following any abatement con-
ference conducted prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1977 shall remain in effect with respect to any pol-
lutant for which no national ambient air quality standard has been
established under section 109 of this Act unless the Administrator,
after consultation with all agencies which were party to the con-
ference, rescinds any such recommendation on grounds of obsoles-
cence.

shall preclude or deny the right of any State or political subdivision
thereof to adopt or enforce (1) any standard or limitation respecting
emissions of air pollutants or (2) any requirement respecting con-
trol or abatement of air pollution; except that if an emission stand-
ard or limitation is in effect under an applicable implementation
plan or under section 111 or 112, such State or political subdivision
may not adopt or enforce any emission standard or limitation
which is less stringent than the standard or limitation under such

and implementation of the purposes of this Act including air qual-
ity criteria, recommended control techniques, standards, research
and development, and to encourage the continued efforts on the
part of industry to improve air quality and to develop economically
feasible methods for the control and abatement of air pollution, the
Administrator shall from time to time establish advisory commit-
tees. Committee members shall include, but not be limited to, per-
sons who are knowledgeable concerning air quality from the stand-
point of health, welfare, economics, or technology.
(b) The members of any other advisory committees appointed
pursuant to this Act who are not officers or employees of the
United States while attending conferences or meetings or while
otherwise serving at the request of the Administrator, shall be enti-
tled to receive compensation at a rate to be fixed by the Adminis-
trator, but not exceeding $100 per diem, including traveltime, and
while away from their homes or regular places of business they
may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of sub-
sistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 5 of the United
States Code for persons in the Government service employed inter-
mittently.

procedural (including any recordkeeping or reporting requirement,
any requirement respecting permits and any other requirement
whatsoever), (B) to any requirement to pay a fee or charge imposed
by any State or local agency to defray the costs of its air pollution
regulatory program, (C) to the exercise of any Federal, State, or
local administrative authority, and (D) to any process and sanction,
whether enforced in Federal, State, or local courts, or in any other
manner. This subsection shall apply notwithstanding any immu-
nity of such agencies, officers, agents, or employees under any law
or rule of law. No officer, agent, or employee of the United States
shall be personally liable for any civil penalty for which he is not
otherwise liable.
(b) The President, may exempt any emission source of any de-
partment, agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch from
compliance with such a requirement if he determines it to be in the
paramount interest of the United States to do so, except that no
exemption may be granted from section 111, and an exemption
from section 112 may be granted only in accordance with section
112(i)(4). No such exemption shall be granted due to lack of appro-
priation unless the President shall have specifically requested such
appropriation as a part of the budgetary process and the Congress
shall have failed to make available such requested appropriation.
Any exemption shall be for a period not in excess of one year, but
additional exemptions may be granted for periods of not to exceed
one year upon the President’s making a new determination. In ad-
dition to any such exemption of a particular emission source, the
President may, if he determines it to be in the paramount interest
of the United States to do so, issue regulations exempting from
compliance with the requirements of this section any weaponry,
equipment, aircraft, vehicles, or other classes or categories of prop-
erty which are owned or operated by the Armed Forces of the
United States (including the Coast Guard) or by the National
Guard of any State and which are uniquely military in nature. The
President shall reconsider the need for such regulations at three-
year intervals. The President shall report each January to the Con-
gress all exemptions from the requirements of this section granted
during the preceding calendar year, together with his reason for
granting each such exemption.

PRIMARY NONFERROUS SMELTER ORDERS
SEC. 119. (a)(1) Upon application by the owner or operator of
a primary nonferrous smelter, a primary nonferrous smelter order
under subsection (b) may be issued—
(A) by the Administrator, after thirty days’ notice to the
State, or
(B) by the State in which such source is located, but no
such order issued by the State shall take effect until the Ad-
ministrator determines that such order has been issued in ac-
cordance with the requirements of this Act.
Not later than ninety days after submission by the State to the Ad-
ministrator of notice of the issuance of a primary nonferrous smelt-
er order under this section, the Administrator shall determine
whether or not such order has been issued by the State in accord-
ance with the requirements of this Act. If the Administrator deter-
mines that such order has not been issued in accordance with such
requirements, he shall conduct a hearing respecting the reasonably
available control technology for primary nonferrous smelters.
(2)(A) An order issued under this section to a primary non-
ferrous smelter shall be referred to as a ‘‘primary nonferrous smelt-
er order’’. No primary nonferrous smelter may receive both an en-
forcement order under section 113(d) 41 and a primary nonferrous
smelter order under this section.
(B) Before any hearing conducted under this section, in the
case of an application made by the owner or operator of a primary
nonferrous smelter for a second order under this section, the appli-
cant shall furnish the Administrator (or the State as the case may
be) with a statement of the grounds on which such application is
based (including all supporting documents and information). The
statement of the grounds for the proposed order shall be provided
by the Administrator or the State in any case in which such State
or Administrator is acting on its own initiative. Such statement (in-
cluding such documents and information) shall be made available
to the public for a thirty-day period before such hearing and shall
be considered as part of such hearing. No primary nonferrous
smelter order may be granted unless the applicant establishes that

he meets the conditions required for the issuance of such order (or
the Administrator or State establishes the meeting of such condi-
tions when acting on their own initiative).
(C) Any decision with respect to the issuance of a primary non-
ferrous smelter order shall be accompanied by a concise statement
of the findings and of the basis of such findings.
(3) For the purposes of section 42 110, 304, and 307 of this Act,
any order issued by the State and in effect pursuant to this sub-
section shall become part of the applicable implementation plan.
(b) A primary nonferrous smelter order under this section may
be issued to a primary nonferrous smelter if—
(1) such smelter is in existence on the date of the enact-
ment of this section;
(2) the requirement of the applicable implementation plan
with respect to which the order is issued is an emission limita-
tion or standard for sulfur oxides which is necessary and in-
tended to be itself sufficient to enable attainment and mainte-
nance of national primary and secondary ambient air quality
standards for sulfur oxides; and
(3) such smelter is unable to comply with such require-
ment by the applicable date for compliance because no means
of emission limitation applicable to such smelter which will en-
able it to achieve compliance with such requirement has been
adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available (as deter-
mined by the Administrator, taking into account the cost of
compliance, nonair quality health and environmental impact,
and energy consideration).
(c)(1) A second order issued to a smelter under this section
shall set forth compliance schedules containing increments of
progress which require compliance with the requirement postponed
as expeditiously as practicable. The increments of progress shall be
limited to requiring compliance with subsection (d) and, in the case
of a second order, to procuring, installing, and operating the nec-
essary means of emission limitation as expeditiously as practicable
after the Administrator determines such means have been ade-
quately demonstrated to be reasonably available within the mean-
ing of subsection (b)(3).
(2) Not in excess of two primary nonferrous smelter orders may
be issued under this section to any primary nonferrous smelter.
The first such order issued to a smelter shall not result in the post-
ponement of the requirement with respect to which such order is
issued beyond January 1, 1983. The second such order shall not re-
sult in the postponement of such requirement beyond January 1,
1988.
(d)(1)(A) Each primary nonferrous smelter to which an order is
issued under this section shall be required to use such interim
measures for the period during which such order is in effect as may
be necessary in the judgment of the Administrator to assure attain-
ment and maintenance of the national primary and secondary am-
bient air quality standards during such period, taking into account
the aggregate effect on air quality of such order together with all
variances, extensions, waivers, enforcement orders, delayed compli-

ance orders and primary nonferrous smelter orders previously
issued under this Act.
(B) Such interim requirements shall include—
(i) a requirement that the source to which the order ap-
plies comply with such reporting requirements and conduct
such monitoring as the Administrator determines may be nec-
essary, and
(ii) such measures as the Administrator determines are
necessary to avoid an imminent and substantial endangerment
to health of persons.
(C) Such interim measures shall also, except as provided in
paragraph (2), include continuous emission reduction technology.
The Administrator shall condition the use of any such interim
measures upon the agreement of the owner or operator of the
smelter—
(i) to comply with such conditions as the Administrator de-
termines are necessary to maximize the reliability and enforce-
ability of such interim measures, as applied to the smelter, in
attaining and maintaining the national ambient air quality
standards to which the order relates, and
(ii) to commit reasonable resources to research and devel-
opment of appropriate emission control technology.
(2) The requirement of paragraph (1) for the use of continuous
emission reduction technology may be waived with respect to a par-
ticular smelter by the State or the Administrator, after notice and
a hearing on the record, and upon a showing by the owner or oper-
ator of the smelter that such requirement would be so costly as to
necessitate permanent or prolonged temporary cessation of oper-
ations of the smelter. Upon application for such waiver, the Admin-
istrator shall be notified and shall, within ninety days, hold a hear-
ing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5 of the
United States Code. At such hearing the Administrator shall re-
quire the smelter involved to present information relating to any
alleged cessation of operations and the detailed reasons or justifica-
tions therefor. On the basis of such hearing the Administrator shall
make findings of fact as to the effect of such requirement and on
the alleged cessation of operations and shall make such rec-
ommendations as he deems appropriate. Such report, findings, and
recommendations shall be available to the public, and shall be
taken into account by the State or the Administrator in making the
decision whether or not to grant such waiver.
(3) In order to obtain information for purposes of a waiver
under paragraph (2), the Administrator may, on his own motion,
conduct an investigation and use the authority of section 321.
(4) In the case of any smelter which on the date of enactment
of this section uses continuous emission reduction technology and
supplemental controls and which receives an initial primary non-
ferrous smelter order under this section, no additional continuous
emission reduction technology shall be required as a condition of
such order unless the Administrator determines, at any time, after
notice and public hearing, that such additional continuous emission
reduction technology is adequately demonstrated to be reasonably
available for the primary nonferrous smelter industry.

shall be terminated if the Administrator determines on the record,
after notice and public hearing, that the conditions upon which the
order was based no longer exist. If the owner or operator of the

mination of such order would result in undue hardship, the termi-
nation shall become effective at the earliest practicable date on
which such undue hardship would not result, but in no event later
than the date required under subsection (c).

order is issued under this section is in violation of any requirement
of subsection (c) or (d), he shall—
(1) enforce such requirement under section 113,
(2) (after notice and opportunity for public hearing) revoke
such order and enforce compliance with the requirement with
respect to which such order was granted,

(6)(A) authorize the Administrator on his own initiative to
review the decision of the State under paragraph (5) and dis-
approve it if it is not in accordance with the requirements of
this section, and (B) require the Administrator to do so not
later than sixty days after receipt of a petition under this sub-
paragraph, notice, and public hearing and a showing by such
petitioner that the State decision under paragraph (5) is not in
accordance with the requirements of this section;
(7) require payment, in accordance with subsection (d), of
the penalty by each person to whom notice of noncompliance
is given under paragraph (3) with respect to each noncom-
plying source for which such notice is given unless there has
been a final determination granting a petition under para-
graph (4)(B) with respect to such source;
(8) authorize the State or the Administrator to adjust (and
from time to time to readjust) the amount of the penalty as-
sessment calculated or the payment schedule proposed by such
owner or operator under paragraph (4), if the Administrator
finds after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record
that the penalty or schedule does not meet the requirements
of this section; and
(9) require a final adjustment of the penalty within 180
days after such source comes into compliance in accordance
with subsection (d)(4).
In any case in which the State establishes a noncompliance penalty
under this section, the State shall provide notice thereof to the Ad-
ministrator. A noncompliance penalty established by a State under
this section shall apply unless the Administrator, within ninety
days after the date of receipt of notice of the State penalty assess-
ment under this section, objects in writing to the amount of the
penalty as less than would be required to comply with guidelines
established by the Administrator. If the Administrator objects, he
shall immediately establish a substitute noncompliance penalty ap-
plicable to such source.

a notice is issued under subsection (b)(3)—
(1) does not submit a timely petition under subsection
(b)(4)(B), or
(2) submits a petition under subsection (b)(4)(B) which is
denied, and
fails to submit a calculation of the penalty assessment, a schedule
for payment, and the information necessary for independent
verification thereof, the State (or the Administrator, as the case
may be) may enter into a contract with any person who has no fi-
nancial interest in the owner or operator of the source (or in any
person controlling, controlled by or under common control with
such source) to assist in determining the amount of the penalty as-
sessment or payment schedule with respect to such source. The
cost of carrying out such contract may be added to the penalty to
be assessed against the owner or operator of such source.

section shall be paid to the United States Treasury. All penalties
assessed by the State under this section shall be paid to such
State.

(2) The amount of the penalty which shall be assessed and col-
lected with respect to any source under this section shall be equal
to— (A) the amount determined in accordance with regulations
promulgated by the Administrator under subsection (a), which
is no less than the economic value which a delay in compliance
beyond July 1, 1979, may have for the owner of such source,
including the quarterly equivalent of the capital costs of com-
pliance and debt service over a normal amortization period, not
to exceed ten years, operation and maintenance costs foregone
as a result of noncompliance, and any additional economic
value which such a delay may have for the owner or operator
of such source, minus
(B) the amount of any expenditure made by the owner or
operator of that source during any such quarter for the pur-
pose of bringing that source into, and maintaining compliance
with, such requirement, to the extent that such expenditures
have not been taken into account in the calculation of the pen-
alty under subparagraph (A).
To the extent that any expenditure under subparagraph (B) made
during any quarter is not subtracted for such quarter from the
costs under subparagraph (A), such expenditure may be subtracted
for any subsequent quarter from such costs. In no event shall the
amount paid be less than the quarterly payment minus the amount
attributed to actual cost of construction.
(3)(A) The assessed penalty required under this section shall
be paid in quarterly installments for the period of covered non-
compliance. All quarterly payments (determined without regard to
any adjustment or any subtraction under paragraph (2)(B)) after
the first payment shall be equal.
(B) The first payment shall be due on the date six months after
the date of issuance of the notice of noncompliance under sub-
section (b)(3) with respect to any source or on January 1, 1980,
whichever is later. Such first payment shall be in the amount of
the quarterly installment for the upcoming quarter, plus the
amount owed for any preceding period within the period of covered
noncompliance for such source.
(C) For the purpose of this section, the term ‘‘period of covered
noncompliance’’ means the period which begins—
(i) two years after the date of enactment of this section, in
the case of a source for which notice of noncompliance under
subsection (b)(3) is issued on or before the date two years after
such date of enactment, or
(ii) on the date of issuance of the notice of noncompliance
under subsection (b)(3), in the case of a source for which such
notice is issued after July 1, 1979,
and ending on the date on which such source comes into (or for the
purpose of establishing the schedule of payments, is estimated to
come into) compliance with such requirement.
(4) Upon making a determination that a source with respect to

ance—
(A) provide reimbursement with interest (to be paid by the
State or Secretary of the Treasury, as the case may be) at ap-
propriate prevailing rates (as determined by the Secretary of
the Treasury) for any overpayment by such person, or
(B) assess and collect an additional payment with interest
at appropriate prevailing rates (as determined by the Secretary
of the Treasury) for any underpayment by such person.
(5) Any person who fails to pay the amount of any penalty with
respect to any source under this section on a timely basis shall be
required to pay in addition a quarterly nonpayment penalty for
each quarter during which such failure to pay persists. Such non-
payment penalty shall be in an amount equal to 20 percent of the
aggregate amount of such person’s penalties and nonpayment pen-
alties with respect to such source which are unpaid as of the begin-
ning of such quarter.
(e) Any action pursuant to this section, including any objection
of the Administrator under the last sentence of subsection (b), shall
be considered a final action for purposes of judicial review of any
penalty under section 307 of this Act.
(f) Any orders, payments, sanctions, or other requirements
under this section shall be in addition to any other permits, orders,
payments, sanctions, or other requirements established under this
Act, and shall in no way affect any civil or criminal enforcement
proceedings brought under any provisions of this Act or State or
local law.
(g) In the case of any emission limitation or other requirement
approved or promulgated by the Administrator under this Act after
the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 which is
more stringent than the emission limitation or requirement for the
source in effect prior to such approval or promulgation, if any, or
where there was no emission limitation or requirement approved or
promulgated before enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1977, the date for imposition of the non-compliance penalty under
this section, shall be either July 1, 1979, or the date on which the
source is required to be in full compliance with such emission limi-
tation or requirement, whichever is later, but in no event later
than three years after the approval or promulgation of such emis-

of this section (two years for radioactive pollutants) and after no-
tice and opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator shall re-
view all available relevant information and determine whether or
not emissions of radioactive pollutants (including source material,
special nuclear material, and byproduct material), cadmium, ar-
senic and polycyclic organic matter into the ambient air will cause,
or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated
to endanger public health. If the Administrator makes an affirma-
tive determination with respect to any such substance, he shall si-
multaneously with such determination include such substance in
the list published under section 108(a)(1) or 112(b)(1)(A) (in the
case of a substance which, in the judgment of the Administrator,
causes, or contributes to, air pollution which may reasonably be an-
ticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in seri-
ous irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness), or shall in-
clude each category of stationary sources emitting such substance

ment with respect to those sources or facilities which are under the
jurisdiction of the Commission. This agreement shall, to the max-

tion of effort and conserve administrative resources in the estab-
lishment, implementation, and enforcement of emission limitations,
standards of performance, and other requirements and authorities
(substantive and procedural) under this Act respecting the emission
of such material (or component or derivative thereof) from such
sources or facilities.

by the Administrator, under this Act or by any State (or the Ad-
ministrator) under any applicable implementation plan under this
Act, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determines, after notice
and opportunity for public hearing that the application of such

STACK HEIGHTS
SEC. 123. (a) The degree of emission limitation required for
control of any air pollutant under an applicable implementation
plan under this title shall not be affected in any manner by—
(1) so much of the stack height of any source as exceeds
good engineering practice (as determined under regulations
promulgated by the Administrator), or
(2) any other dispersion technique.
The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to stack
heights in existence before the date of enactment of the Clean Air
Amendments of 1970 or dispersion techniques implemented before
such date. In establishing an emission limitation for coal-fired
steam electric generating units which are subject to the provisions
of section 118 and which commenced operation before July 1, 1957,
the effect of the entire stack height of stacks for which a construc-
tion contract was awarded before February 8, 1974, may be taken
into account.
(b) For the purpose of this section, the term ‘‘dispersion tech-
nique’’ includes any intermittent or supplemental control of air pol-
lutants varying with atmospheric conditions.
(c) Not later than six months after the date of enactment of
this section, the Administrator, shall after notice and opportunity
for public hearing, promulgate regulations to carry out this section.
For purposes of this section, good engineering practice means, with
respect to stack heights, the height necessary to insure that emis-
sions from the stack do not result in excessive concentrations of
any air pollutant in the immediate vicinity of the source as a result
of atmospheric downwash, eddies and wakes which may be created
by the source itself, nearby structures or nearby terrain obstacles

one year after date of enactment of this section, each State shall
review the provisions of its implementation plan which relate to
major fuel burning sources and shall determine—
(1) the extent to which compliance with requirements of
such plan is dependent upon the use by major fuel burning sta-
tionary sources of petroleum products or natural gas,
(2) the extent to which such plan may reasonably be an-
ticipated to be inadequate to meet the requirements of this Act
in such State on a reliable and long-term basis by reason of its
dependence upon the use of such fuels, and
(3) the extent to which compliance with the requirements
of such plan is dependent upon use of coal or coal derivatives
which is not locally or regionally available.
Each State shall submit the results of its review and its determina-
tion under this paragraph to the Administrator promptly upon
completion thereof.
(b)(1) Not later than eighteen months after the date of enact-
ment of this section, the Administrator shall review the submis-
sions of the States under subsection (a) and shall require each
State to revise its plan if, in the judgment of the Administrator,
such plan revision is necessary to assure that such plan will be
adequate to assure compliance with the requirements of this Act in
such State on a reliable and long-term basis, taking into account
the actual or potential prohibitions on use of petroleum products or
natural gas, or both, under any other authority of law.
(2) Before requiring a plan revision under this subsection, with
respect to any State the Administrator shall take into account the
report of the review conducted by such State under paragraph (1)
and shall consult with the Governor of the State respecting such
required revision.

(a) NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—(A) The Administrator shall establish
performance standards and other requirements pursuant to
section 111 and this section for each category of solid waste in-
cineration units. Such standards shall include emissions limi-
tations and other requirements applicable to new units and
guidelines (under section 111(d) and this section) and other re-
quirements applicable to existing units.
(B) Standards under section 111 and this section applica-
ble to solid waste incineration units with capacity greater than
250 tons per day combusting municipal waste shall be promul-
gated not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Nothing in this sub-
paragraph shall alter any schedule for the promulgation of
standards applicable to such units under section 111 pursuant
to any settlement and consent decree entered by the Adminis-
trator before the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990: Provided, That, such standards are sub-
sequently modified pursuant to the schedule established in this
subparagraph to include each of the requirements of this sec-
tion.
(C) Standards under section 111 and this section applica-
ble to solid waste incineration units with capacity equal to or
less than 250 tons per day combusting municipal waste and
units combusting hospital waste, medical waste and infectious
waste shall be promulgated not later than 24 months after the

under section 111 and this section applicable to other cat-
egories of solid waste incineration units.
(2) EMISSIONS STANDARD.—Standards applicable to solid
waste incineration units promulgated under section 111 and
this section shall reflect the maximum degree of reduction in
emissions of air pollutants listed under section 50 (a)(4) that the
Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving
such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and
environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is
achievable for new or existing units in each category. The Ad-
ministrator may distinguish among classes, types (including
mass-burn, refuse-derived fuel, modular and other types of
units), and sizes of units within a category in establishing such
standards. The degree of reduction in emissions that is deemed
achievable for new units in a category shall not be less strin-
gent than the emissions control that is achieved in practice by
the best controlled similar unit, as determined by the Adminis-
trator. Emissions standards for existing units in a category
may be less stringent than standards for new units in the
same category but shall not be less stringent than the average
emissions limitation achieved by the best performing 12 per-
cent of units in the category (excluding units which first met
lowest achievable emissions rates 18 months before the date
such standards are proposed or 30 months before the date such
standards are promulgated, whichever is later).
(3) CONTROL METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES.—Standards
under section 111 and this section applicable to solid waste in-
cineration units shall be based on methods and technologies for
removal or destruction of pollutants before, during, or after
combustion, and shall incorporate for new units siting require-
ments that minimize, on a site specific basis, to the maximum
extent practicable, potential risks to public health or the envi-
ronment.
(4) NUMERICAL EMISSIONS LIMITATIONS.—The performance
standards promulgated under section 111 and this section and
applicable to solid waste incineration units shall specify nu-
merical emission limitations for the following substances or
mixtures: particulate matter (total and fine), opacity (as appro-
priate), sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, oxides of nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, lead, cadmium, mercury, and dioxins and
dibenzofurans. The Administrator may promulgate numerical
emissions limitations or provide for the monitoring of
postcombustion concentrations of surrogate substances, param-
eters or periods of residence time in excess of stated tempera-
tures with respect to pollutants other than those listed in this
paragraph.
(5) REVIEW AND REVISION.—Not later than 5 years fol-
lowing the initial promulgation of any performance standards
and other requirements under this section and section 111 ap-
plicable to a category of solid waste incineration units, and at
5 year intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall review, and

in accordance with this section and section 111, revise such
standards and requirements.
(b) EXISTING UNITS.—
(1) GUIDELINES.—Performance standards under this sec-
tion and section 111 for solid waste incineration units shall in-
clude guidelines promulgated pursuant to section 111(d) and
this section applicable to existing units. Such guidelines shall
include, as provided in this section, each of the elements re-
quired by subsection (a) (emissions limitations, notwith-
standing any restriction in section 111(d) regarding issuance of
such limitations), subsection (c) (monitoring), subsection (d)
(operator training), subsection (e) (permits), and subsection
(h)(4) 51 (residual risk).
(2) STATE PLANS.—Not later than 1 year after the Adminis-
trator promulgates guidelines for a category of solid waste in-
cineration units, each State in which units in the category are
operating shall submit to the Administrator a plan to imple-
ment and enforce the guidelines with respect to such units.
The State plan shall be at least as protective as the guidelines
promulgated by the Administrator and shall provide that each
unit subject to the guidelines shall be in compliance with all
requirements of this section not later than 3 years after the
State plan is approved by the Administrator but not later than
5 years after the guidelines were promulgated. The Adminis-
trator shall approve or disapprove any State plan within 180
days of the submission, and if a plan is disapproved, the Ad-
ministrator shall state the reasons for disapproval in writing.
Any State may modify and resubmit a plan which has been
disapproved by the Administrator.
(3) FEDERAL PLAN.—The Administrator shall develop, im-
plement and enforce a plan for existing solid waste inciner-
ation units within any category located in any State which has
not submitted an approvable plan under this subsection with
respect to units in such category within 2 years after the date
on which the Administrator promulgated the relevant guide-
lines. Such plan shall assure that each unit subject to the plan
is in compliance with all provisions of the guidelines not later
than 5 years after the date the relevant guidelines are promul-
gated.
(c) MONITORING.—The Administrator shall, as part of each per-
formance standard promulgated pursuant to subsection (a) and sec-
tion 111, promulgate regulations requiring the owner or operator of
each solid waste incineration unit—
(1) to monitor emissions from the unit at the point at
which such emissions are emitted into the ambient air (or
within the stack, combustion chamber or pollution control
equipment, as appropriate) and at such other points as nec-
essary to protect public health and the environment;
(2) to monitor such other parameters relating to the oper-
ation of the unit and its pollution control technology as the Ad-
ministrator determines are appropriate; and
(3) to report the results of such monitoring.

Such regulations shall contain provisions regarding the frequency
of monitoring, test methods and procedures validated on solid
waste incineration units, and the form and frequency of reports
containing the results of monitoring and shall require that any
monitoring reports or test results indicating an exceedance of any
standard under this section shall be reported separately and in a
manner that facilitates review for purposes of enforcement actions.
Such regulations shall require that copies of the results of such
monitoring be maintained on file at the facility concerned and that
copies shall be made available for inspection and copying by inter-
ested members of the public during business hours.
(d) OPERATOR TRAINING.—Not later than 24 months after the
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Adminis-
trator shall develop and promote a model State program for the
training and certification of solid waste incineration unit operators
and high-capacity fossil fuel fired plant operators. The Adminis-
trator may authorize any State to implement a model program for
the training of solid waste incineration unit operators and high-ca-
pacity fossil fuel fired plant operators, if the State has adopted a
program which is at least as effective as the model program devel-
oped by the Administrator. Beginning on the date 36 months after
the date on which performance standards and guidelines are pro-
mulgated under subsection (a) and section 111 for any category of
solid waste incineration units it shall be unlawful to operate any
unit in the category unless each person with control over processes
affecting emissions from such unit has satisfactorily completed a
training program meeting the requirements established by the Ad-
ministrator under this subsection.
(e) PERMITS.—Beginning (1) 36 months after the promulgation
of a performance standard under subsection (a) and section 111 ap-
plicable to a category of solid waste incineration units, or (2) the
effective date of a permit program under title V in the State in
which the unit is located, whichever is later, each unit in the cat-
egory shall operate pursuant to a permit issued under this sub-
section and title V. Permits required by this subsection may be re-
newed according to the provisions of title V. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Act, each permit for a solid waste inciner-
ation unit combusting municipal waste issued under this Act shall
be issued for a period of up to 12 years and shall be reviewed every
5 years after date of issuance or reissuance. Each permit shall con-
tinue in effect after the date of issuance until the date of termi-
nation, unless the Administrator or State determines that the unit
is not in compliance with all standards and conditions contained in
the permit. Such determination shall be made at regular intervals
during the term of the permit, such intervals not to exceed 5 years,
and only after public comment and public hearing. No permit for
a solid waste incineration unit may be issued under this Act by an
agency, instrumentality or person that is also responsible, in whole
or part, for the design and construction or operation of the unit.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the Admin-
istrator or the State shall require the owner or operator of any unit
to comply with emissions limitations or implement any other meas-
ures, if the Administrator or the State determines that emissions
in the absence of such limitations or measures may reasonably be

tion.(2) EXISTING UNITS.—Performance standards and other re-
quirements promulgated pursuant to this section and section
111 and applicable to existing solid waste incineration units
shall be effective as expeditiously as practicable after approval
of a State plan under subsection (b)(2) (or promulgation of a
plan by the Administrator under subsection (b)(3)) but in no
event later than 3 years after the State plan is approved or 5
years after the date such standards or requirements are pro-
mulgated, whichever is earlier.
(3) PROHIBITION.—After the effective date of any perform-
ance standard, emission limitation or other requirement pro-
mulgated pursuant to this section and section 111, it shall be
unlawful for any owner or operator of any solid waste inciner-
ation unit to which such standard, limitation or requirement
applies to operate such unit in violation of such limitation,
standard or requirement or for any other person to violate an
applicable requirement of this section.

SUBPART 1
PURPOSES
SEC. 160. The purposes of this part are as follows:
(1) to protect public health and welfare from any actual or
potential adverse effect which in the Administrator’s judgment
may reasonably be anticipate 55 to occur from air pollution or
from exposures to pollutants in other media, which pollutants
originate as emissions to the ambient air), 56 notwithstanding
attainment and maintenance of all national ambient air qual-
ity standards;
(2) to preserve, protect, and enhance the air quality in na-
tional parks, national wilderness areas, national monuments,
national seashores, and other areas of special national or re-
gional natural, recreational, scenic, or historic value;
(3) to insure that economic growth will occur in a manner
consistent with the preservation of existing clean air resources;
(4) to assure that emissions from any source in any State
will not interfere with any portion of the applicable implemen-
tation plan to prevent significant deterioration of air quality
for any other State; and
(5) to assure that any decision to permit increased air pol-
lution in any area to which this section applies is made only
after careful evaluation of all the consequences of such a deci-
sion and after adequate procedural opportunities for informed
public participation in the decisionmaking process.

AREA REDESIGNATION
S EC. 164. (a) Except as otherwise provided under subsection
(c), a State may redesignate such areas as it deems appropriate as
class I areas. The following areas may be redesignated only as class
I or II: (1) an area which exceeds ten thousand acres in size and
is a national monument, a national primitive area, a national
preserve, a national recreation area, a national wild and scenic
river, a national wildlife refuge, a national lakeshore or sea-
shore, and
(2) a national park or national wilderness area established
after the date of enactment of this Act which exceeds ten thou-
sand acres in size.
The extent of the areas referred to in paragraph 58 (1) and (2) shall
conform to any changes in the boundaries of such areas which have
occurred subsequent to the date of the enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1977, or which may occur subsequent to the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 59
Any area (other than an area referred to in paragraph (1) or (2)
or an area established as class I under the first sentence of section
162(a)) may be redesignated by the State as class III if—
(A) such redesignation has been specifically approved by
the Governor of the State, after consultation with the appro-
priate Committees of the legislature if it is in session or with
the leadership of the legislature if it is not in session (unless

approved by State legislation) and if general purpose units of
local government representing a majority of the residents of
the area so redesignated enact legislation (including for such
units of local government resolutions where appropriate) con-
curring in the State’s redesignation;
(B) such redesignation will not cause, or contribute to, con-
centrations of any air pollutant which exceed any maximum al-
lowable increase or maximum allowable concentration per-
mitted under the classification of any other area; and
(C) such redesignation otherwise meets the requirements
of this part.
Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply to area redes-
ignations by Indian tribes.
(b)(1)(A) Prior to redesignation of any area under this part, no-
tice shall be afforded and public hearings shall be conducted in
areas proposed to be redesignated and in areas which may be af-
fected by the proposed redesignation. Prior to any such public hear-
ing a satisfactory description and analysis of the health, environ-
mental, economic, social, and energy effects of the proposed redes-
ignation shall be prepared and made available for public inspection
and prior to any such redesignation, the description and analysis
of such effects shall be reviewed and examined by the redesig-
nating authorities.
(B) Prior to the issuance of notice under subparagraph (A) re-
specting the redesignation of any area under this subsection, if
such area includes any Federal lands, the State shall provide writ-
ten notice to the appropriate Federal land manager and afford ade-
quate opportunity (but not in excess of 60 days) to confer with the
State respecting the intended notice of redesignation and to submit
written comments and recommendations with respect to such in-
tended notice of redesignation. In redesignating any area under
this section with respect to which any Federal land manager has
submitted written comments and recommendations, the State shall
publish a list of any inconsistency between such redesignation and
such recommendations and an explanation of such inconsistency
(together with the reasons for making such redesignation against
the recommendation of the Federal land manager).
(C) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations not later
than six months after date of enactment of this part, to assure, in-
sofar as practicable, that prior to any public hearing on redesigna-
tion of any area, there shall be available for public inspection any
specific plans for any new or modified major emitting facility which
may be permitted to be constructed and operated only if the area
in question is designated or redesignated as class III.
(2) The Administrator may disapprove the redesignation of any
area only if he finds, after notice and opportunity for public hear-
ing, that such redesignation does not meet the procedural require-
ments of this section or is inconsistent with the requirements of
section 162(a) or of subsection (a) of this section. If any such dis-
approval occurs, the classification of the area shall be that which
was in effect prior to the redesignation which was disapproved.

be subject in all respect to the provisions of subsection (e).
(d) The Federal Land Manager shall review all national monu-
ments, primitive areas, and national preserves, and shall rec-
ommend any appropriate areas for redesignation as class I where
air quality related values are important attributes of the area. The
Federal Land Manager shall report such recommendations, with-
in 60 supporting analysis, to the Congress and the affected States
within one year after enactment of this section. The Federal Land
Manager shall consult with the appropriate States before making
such recommendations.
(e) If any State affected by the redesignation of any area by an
Indian tribe or any Indian tribe affected by the redesignation of an
area by a State disagrees with such redesignation of any area, or
if a permit is proposed to be issued for any new major emitting fa-
cility proposed for construction in any State which the Governor of
an affected State or governing body of an affected Indian tribe de-
termines will cause or contribute to a cumulative change in air
quality in excess of that allowed in this part within the affected
State or tribal reservation, the Governor or Indian ruling body may
request the Administrator to enter into negotiations with the par-
ties involved to resolve such dispute. If requested by any State or
Indian tribe involved, the Administrator shall make a recommenda-
tion to resolve the dispute and protect the air quality related val-
ues of the lands involved. If the parties involved do not reach
agreement, the Administrator shall resolve the dispute and his de-
termination, or the results of agreements reached through other
means, shall become part of the applicable plan and shall be en-
forceable as part of such plan. In resolving such disputes relating
to area redesignation, the Administrator shall consider the extent
to which the lands involved are of sufficient size to allow effective
air quality management or have air quality related values of such
an area.

tribute to exceeding the maximum allowable increments appli-
cable in a class II area and where no standard under section
111 of this Act has been promulgated subsequent to enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, for such source cat-
egory, the Administrator has approved the determination of
best available technology as set forth in the permit.
(b) The demonstration pertaining to maximum allowable in-
creases required under subsection (a)(3) shall not apply to max-
imum allowable increases for class II areas in the case of an expan-

ance with subsection (a)(4), will be less than fifty tons per year and
for which the owner or operator of such facility demonstrates that
emissions of particulate matter and sulfur oxides will not cause or
contribute to ambient air quality levels in excess of the national
secondary ambient air quality standard for either of such pollut-
ants.

which exceed the maximum allowable increases for a class I area.
(ii) In any case where the Federal Land Manager demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the State that the emissions from such facility
will have an adverse impact on the air quality-related values (in-
cluding visibility) of such lands, notwithstanding the fact that the
change in air quality resulting from emissions from such facility
will not cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the
maximum allowable increases for a class I area, a permit shall not

and may contain air quality increments, emission density require-
ments, or other measures.
(e) With respect to any air pollutant for which a national ambi-
ent air quality standard is established other than sulfur oxides or
particulate matter, an area classification plan shall not be required
under this section if the implementation plan adopted by the State
and submitted for the Administrator’s approval or promulgated by
the Administrator under section 110(c) contains other provisions
which when considered as a whole, the Administrator finds will
carry out the purposes in section 160 at least as effectively as an
area classification plan for such pollutant. Such other provisions re-
ferred to in the preceding sentence need not require the establish-

VISIBILITY PROTECTION FOR FEDERAL CLASS I AREAS
S EC. 169A. (a)(1) Congress hereby declares as a national goal
the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing,
impairment of visibility in mandatory class I Federal areas which
impairment results from manmade air pollution.
(2) Not later than six months after the date of the enactment
of this section, the Secretary of the Interior in consultation with
other Federal land managers shall review all mandatory class I
Federal areas and identify those where visibility is an important
value of the area. From time to time the Secretary of the Interior
may revise such identifications. Not later than one year after such
date of enactment, the Administrator shall, after consultation with
the Secretary of the Interior, promulgate a list of mandatory class
I Federal areas in which he determines visibility is an important
value.
(3) Not later than eighteen months after the date of enactment
of this section, the Administrator shall complete a study and report
to Congress on available methods for implementing the national
goal set forth in paragraph (1). Such report shall include rec-
ommendations for—
(A) methods for identifying, characterizing, determining,
quantifying, and measuring visibility impairment in Federal
areas referred to in paragraph (1), and
(B) modeling techniques (or other methods) for deter-
mining the extent to which manmade air pollution may reason-
ably be anticipated to cause or contribute to such impairment,
and (C) methods for preventing and remedying such manmade
air pollution and resulting visibility impairment.
Such report shall also identify the classes or categories of sources
and the types of air pollutants which, alone or in conjunction with
other sources or pollutants, may reasonably be anticipated to cause
or contribute significantly to impairment of visibility.
(4) Not later than twenty-four months after the date of enact-
ment of this section, and after notice and public hearing, the Ad-
ministrator shall promulgate regulations to assure (A) reasonable
progress toward meeting the national goal specified in paragraph
(1), and (B) compliance with the requirements of this section.

the recommendations under subsection (a)(3) on appropriate
techniques and methods for implementing this section (as pro-
vided in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of such subsection
(a)(3)), and
(2) require each applicable implementation plan for a State
in which any area listed by the Administrator under subsection
(a)(2) is located (or for a State the emissions from which may
reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impair-
ment of visibility in any such area) to contain such emission
limits, schedules of compliance and other measures as may be
necessary to make reasonable progress toward meeting the na-
tional goal specified in subsection (a), including—
(A) except as otherwise provided pursuant to sub-
section (c), a requirement that each major stationary
source which is in existence on the date of enactment of
this section, but which has not been in operation for more
than fifteen years as of such date, and which, as deter-
mined by the State (or the Administrator in the case of a
plan promulgated under section 110(c)) emits any air pol-
lutant which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or
contribute to any impairment of visibility in any such area,
shall procure, install, and operate, as expeditiously as
practicable (and maintain thereafter) the best available
retrofit technology, as determined by the State (or the Ad-
ministrator in the case of a plan promulgated under sec-
tion 110(c)) for controlling emissions from such source for
the purpose of eliminating or reducing any such impair-
ment, and
(B) a long-term (ten to fifteen years) strategy for mak-
ing reasonable progress toward meeting the national goal
specified in subsection (a).
In the case of a fossil-fuel fired generating powerplant having a
total generating capacity in excess of 750 megawatts, the emission
limitations required under this paragraph shall be determined pur-
suant to guidelines, promulgated by the Administrator under para-
graph (1).
(c)(1) The Administrator may, by rule, after notice and oppor-
tunity for public hearing, exempt any major stationary source from
the requirement of subsection (b)(2)(A), upon his determination
that such source does not or will not, by itself or in combination
with other sources, emit any air pollutant which may reasonably
be anticipated to cause or contribute to a significant impairment of
visibility in any mandatory class I Federal area.
(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be applicable to
any fossil-fuel fired powerplant with total design capacity of 750
megawatts or more, unless the owner or operator of any such plant
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that such
powerplant is located at such distance from all areas listed by the
Administrator under subsection (a)(2) that such powerplant does
not or will not, by itself or in combination with other sources, emit
any air pollutant which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or
contribute to significant impairment of visibility in any such area.

areas located in the affected States, the Administrator may es-
tablish a transport region for such pollutants that includes
such States. The Administrator, upon the Administrator’s own
motion or upon petition from the Governor of any affected
State, or upon the recommendations of a transport commission
established under subsection (b) of this section 64 may—
(A) add any State or portion of a State to a visibility
transport region when the Administrator determines that
the interstate transport of air pollutants from such State
significantly contributes to visibility impairment in a class
I area located within the transport region, or
(B) remove any State or portion of a State from the re-
gion whenever the Administrator has reason to believe
that the control of emissions in that State or portion of the
State pursuant to this section will not significantly con-
tribute to the protection or enhancement of visibility in
any class I area in the region.
(2) VISIBILITY TRANSPORT COMMISSIONS.—Whenever the
Administrator establishes a transport region under subsection
(c)(1), the Administrator shall establish a transport commission
comprised of (as a minimum) each of the following members:

(1) REASONABLE FURTHER PROGRESS.—The term ‘‘reason-
able further progress’’ means such annual incremental reduc-
tions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required
by this part or may reasonably be required by the Adminis-
trator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable
national ambient air quality standard by the applicable date.
(2) N ONATTAINMENT AREA.—The term ‘‘nonattainment
area’’ means, for any air pollutant, an area which is designated
‘‘nonattainment’’ with respect to that pollutant within the
meaning of section 107(d).
(3) The term ‘‘lowest achievable emission rate’’ means for
any source, that rate of emissions which reflects—
(A) the most stringent emission limitation which is
contained in the implementation plan of any State for such
class or category of source, unless the owner or operator of
the proposed source demonstrates that such limitations
are not achievable, or
(B) the most stringent emission limitation which is
achieved in practice by such class or category of source,
whichever is more stringent.
In no event shall the application of this term permit a pro-
posed new or modified source to emit any pollutant in excess
of the amount allowable under applicable new source stand-
ards of performance.
(4) The terms ‘‘modifications’’ and ‘‘modified’’ mean the
same as the term ‘‘modification’’ as used in section 111(a)(4) of
this Act.

SEC. 172. NONATTAINMENT PLAN PROVISIONS IN GENERAL.
(a) CLASSIFICATIONS AND ATTAINMENT DATES.—
(1) CLASSIFICATIONS.—(A) On or after the date the Admin-
istrator promulgates the designation of an area as a nonattain-
ment area pursuant to section 107(d) with respect to any na-
tional ambient air quality standard (or any revised standard,
including a revision of any standard in effect on the date of the
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990), the Ad-
ministrator may classify the area for the purpose of applying
an attainment date pursuant to paragraph (2), and for other
purposes. In determining the appropriate classification, if any,
for a nonattainment area, the Administrator may consider
such factors as the severity of nonattainment in such area and
the availability and feasibility of the pollution control meas-
ures that the Administrator believes may be necessary to pro-
vide for attainment of such standard in such area.
(B) The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal
Register announcing each classification under subparagraph
(A), except the Administrator shall provide an opportunity for
at least 30 days for written comment. Such classification shall
not be subject to the provisions of sections 553 through 557 of
title 5 of the United States Code (concerning notice and com-
ment) and shall not be subject to judicial review until the Ad-
ministrator takes final action under subsection (k) or (l) of sec-
tion 110 (concerning action on plan submissions) or section 179

(concerning sanctions) with respect to any plan submissions re-
quired by virtue of such classification.
(C) This paragraph shall not apply with respect to non-
attainment areas for which classifications are specifically pro-
vided under other provisions of this part.
(2) ATTAINMENT DATES FOR NONATTAINMENT AREAS.—(A)
The attainment date for an area designated nonattainment
with respect to a national primary ambient air quality stand-
ard shall be the date by which attainment can be achieved as
expeditiously as practicable, but no later than 5 years from the
date such area was designated nonattainment under section
107(d), except that the Administrator may extend the attain-
ment date to the extent the Administrator determines appro-
priate, for a period no greater than 10 years from the date of
designation as nonattainment, considering the severity of non-
attainment and the availability and feasibility of pollution con-
trol measures.
(B) The attainment date for an area designated nonattain-
ment with respect to a secondary national ambient air quality
standard shall be the date by which attainment can be
achieved as expeditiously as practicable after the date such
area was designated nonattainment under section 107(d).
(C) Upon application by any State, the Administrator may
extend for 1 additional year (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Ex-
tension Year’’) the attainment date determined by the Admin-
istrator under subparagraph (A) or (B) if—
(i) the State has complied with all requirements and
commitments pertaining to the area in the applicable im-
plementation plan, and
(ii) in accordance with guidance published by the Ad-
ministrator, no more than a minimal number of
exceedances of the relevant national ambient air quality
standard has occurred in the area in the year preceding
the Extension Year.
No more than 2 one-year extensions may be issued under this
subparagraph for a single nonattainment area.
(D) This paragraph shall not apply with respect to non-
attainment areas for which attainment dates are specifically
provided under other provisions of this part.
(b) SCHEDULE FOR PLAN SUBMISSIONS.—At the time the Ad-
ministrator promulgates the designation of an area as nonattain-
ment with respect to a national ambient air quality standard under
section 107(d), the Administrator shall establish a schedule accord-
ing to which the State containing such area shall submit a plan or
plan revision (including the plan items) meeting the applicable re-
quirements of subsection (c) and section 110(a)(2). Such schedule
shall at a minimum, include a date or dates, extending no later
than 3 years from the date of the nonattainment designation, for
the submission of a plan or plan revision (including the plan items)
meeting the applicable requirements of subsection (c) and section
110(a)(2).
(c) NONATTAINMENT PLAN PROVISIONS.—The plan provisions
(including plan items) required to be submitted under this part
shall comply with each of the following:

(1) IN GENERAL.—Such plan provisions shall provide for
the implementation of all reasonably available control meas-
ures as expeditiously as practicable (including such reductions
in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be ob-
tained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably
available control technology) and shall provide for attainment
of the national primary ambient air quality standards.
(2) RFP.—Such plan provisions shall require reasonable
further progress.
(3) INVENTORY.—Such plan provisions shall include a com-
prehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions
from all sources of the relevant pollutant or pollutants in such
area, including such periodic revisions as the Administrator
may determine necessary to assure that the requirements of
this part are met.
(4) IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION.—Such plan pro-
visions shall expressly identify and quantify the emissions, if
any, of any such pollutant or pollutants which will be allowed,
in accordance with section 173(a)(1)(B), from the construction
and operation of major new or modified stationary sources in
each such area. The plan shall demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Administrator that the emissions quantified for this pur-
pose will be consistent with the achievement of reasonable fur-
ther progress and will not interfere with attainment of the ap-
plicable national ambient air quality standard by the applica-
ble attainment date.
(5) PERMITS FOR NEW AND MODIFIED MAJOR STATIONARY
SOURCES.—Such plan provisions shall require permits for the
construction and operation of new or modified major stationary
sources anywhere in the nonattainment area, in accordance
with section 173.
(6) OTHER MEASURES.—Such plan provisions shall include
enforceable emission limitations, and such other control meas-
ures, means or techniques (including economic incentives such
as fees, marketable permits, and auctions of emission rights),
as well as schedules and timetables for compliance, as may be
necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment of such
standard in such area by the applicable attainment date speci-
fied in this part.
(7) C OMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 110(a)(2).—Such plan provi-
sions shall also meet the applicable provisions of section
110(a)(2).
(8) EQUIVALENT TECHNIQUES.—Upon application by any
State, the Administrator may allow the use of equivalent mod-
eling, emission inventory, and planning procedures, unless the
Administrator determines that the proposed techniques are, in
the aggregate, less effective than the methods specified by the
Administrator.
(9) CONTINGENCY MEASURES.—Such plan shall provide for
the implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if
the area fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain
the national primary ambient air quality standard by the at-
tainment date applicable under this part. Such measures shall
be included in the plan revision as contingency measures to

take effect in any such case without further action by the State
or the Administrator.
(d) PLAN REVISIONS REQUIRED IN RESPONSE TO FINDING OF
PLAN INADEQUACY.—Any plan revision for a nonattainment area
which is required to be submitted in response to a finding by the
Administrator pursuant to section 110(k)(5) (relating to calls for
plan revisions) must correct the plan deficiency (or deficiencies)
specified by the Administrator and meet all other applicable plan
requirements of section 110 and this part. The Administrator may
reasonably adjust the dates otherwise applicable under such re-
quirements to such revision (except for attainment dates that have
not yet elapsed), to the extent necessary to achieve a consistent ap-
plication of such requirements. In order to facilitate submittal by
the States of adequate and approvable plans consistent with the
applicable requirements of this Act, the Administrator shall, as ap-
propriate and from time to time, issue written guidelines, interpre-
tations, and information to the States which shall be available to
the public, taking into consideration any such guidelines, interpre-
tations, or information provided before the date of the enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
(e) FUTURE MODIFICATION OF STANDARD.—If the Administrator
relaxes a national primary ambient air quality standard after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
the Administrator shall, within 12 months after the relaxation, pro-
mulgate requirements applicable to all areas which have not at-
tained that standard as of the date of such relaxation. Such re-
quirements shall provide for controls which are not less stringent
than the controls applicable to areas designated nonattainment be-
fore such relaxation.

be issued if—
(1) in accordance with regulations issued by the Adminis-
trator for the determination of baseline emissions in a manner
consistent with the assumptions underlying the applicable im-
plementation plan approved under section 110 and this part,
the permitting agency determines that—
(A) by the time the source is to commence operation,
sufficient offsetting emissions reductions have been ob-
tained, such that total allowable emissions from existing
sources in the region, from new or modified sources which
are not major emitting facilities, and from the proposed
source will be sufficiently less than total emissions from
existing sources (as determined in accordance with the reg-
ulations under this paragraph) prior to the application for

72 So in original. Probably the word ‘‘and’’ should be deleted.
(B) in the case of a new or modified major stationary
source which is located in a zone (within the nonattain-
ment area) identified by the Administrator, in consultation
with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as
a zone to which economic development should be targeted,
that 71 emissions of such pollutant resulting from the pro-
posed new or modified major stationary source will not
cause or contribute to emissions levels which exceed the al-
lowance permitted for such pollutant for such area from
new or modified major stationary sources under section
172(c);
(2) the proposed source is required to comply with the low-
est achievable emission rate;
(3) the owner or operator of the proposed new or modified
source has demonstrated that all major stationary sources
owned or operated by such person (or by any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with such person) in
such State are subject to emission limitations and are in com-
pliance, or on a schedule for compliance, with all applicable
emission limitations and standards under this Act; and 72
(4) the Administrator has not determined that the applica-
ble implementation plan is not being adequately implemented
for the nonattainment area in which the proposed source is to
be constructed or modified in accordance with the require-
ments of this part; and
(5) an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production proc-
esses, and environmental control techniques for such proposed
source demonstrates that benefits of the proposed source sig-
nificantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed
as a result of its location, construction, or modification.
Any emission reductions required as a precondition of the issuance
of a permit under paragraph (1) shall be federally enforceable be-
fore such permit may be issued.
(b) P ROHIBITION ON USE OF OLD GROWTH ALLOWANCES.—Any
growth allowance included in an applicable implementation plan to
meet the requirements of section 172(b)(5) (as in effect immediately
before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990) shall not be valid for use in any area that received or re-
ceives a notice under section 110(a)(2)(H)(ii) (as in effect imme-
diately before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990) or under section 110(k)(1) that its applicable
implementation plan containing such allowance is substantially in-
adequate.
(c) OFFSETS.—(1) The owner or operator of a new or modified
major stationary source may comply with any offset requirement in
effect under this part for increased emissions of any air pollutant
only by obtaining emission reductions of such air pollutant from
the same source or other sources in the same nonattainment area,
except that the State may allow the owner or operator of a source
to obtain such emission reductions in another nonattainment area
if (A) the other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classi-

fication than the area in which the source is located and (B) emis-
sions from such other area contribute to a violation of the national
ambient air quality standard in the nonattainment area in which
the source is located. Such emission reductions shall be, by the
time a new or modified source commences operation, in effect and
enforceable and shall assure that the total tonnage of increased
emissions of the air pollutant from the new or modified source shall
be offset by an equal or greater reduction, as applicable, in the ac-
tual emissions of such air pollutant from the same or other sources
in the area.
(2) Emission reductions otherwise required by this Act shall
not be creditable as emissions reductions for purposes of any such
offset requirement. Incidental emission reductions which are not
otherwise required by this Act shall be creditable as emission re-
ductions for such purposes if such emission reductions meet the re-
quirements of paragraph (1).
(d) CONTROL TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION.—The State shall pro-
vide that control technology information from permits issued under
this section will be promptly submitted to the Administrator for
purposes of making such information available through the RACT/
BACT/LAER clearinghouse to other States and to the general pub-
lic. (e) ROCKET ENGINES OR MOTORS.—The permitting authority of
a State shall allow a source to offset by alternative or innovative
means emission increases from rocket engine and motor firing, and
cleaning related to such firing, at an existing or modified major
source that tests rocket engines or motors under the following con-
ditions: (1) Any modification proposed is solely for the purpose of
expanding the testing of rocket engines or motors at an exist-
ing source that is permitted to test such engines on the date
of enactment of this subsection.
(2) The source demonstrates to the satisfaction of the per-
mitting authority of the State that it has used all reasonable
means to obtain and utilize offsets, as determined on an an-
nual basis, for the emissions increases beyond allowable levels,
that all available offsets are being used, and that sufficient off-
sets are not available to the source.
(3) The source has obtained a written finding from the De-
partment of Defense, Department of Transportation, National
Aeronautics and Space Administration or other appropriate
Federal agency, that the testing of rocket motors or engines at
the facility is required for a program essential to the national
security.
(4) The source will comply with an alternative measure,
imposed by the permitting authority, designed to offset any
emission increases beyond permitted levels not directly offset
by the source. In lieu of imposing any alternative offset meas-
ures, the permitting authority may impose an emissions fee to
be paid to such authority of a State which shall be an amount
no greater than 1.5 times the average cost of stationary source
control measures adopted in that area during the previous 3
years. The permitting authority shall utilize the fees in a man-
ner that maximizes the emissions reductions in that area.

(a) IN GENERAL.—For any ozone, carbon monoxide, or PM–10
nonattainment area, the State containing such area and elected of-
ficials of affected local governments shall, before the date required
for submittal of the inventory described under sections 182(a)(1)
and 187(a)(1), jointly review and update as necessary the planning
procedures adopted pursuant to this subsection as in effect imme-
diately before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, or develop new planning procedures pursu-
ant to this subsection, as appropriate. In preparing such procedures
the State and local elected officials shall determine which elements
of a revised implementation plan will be developed, adopted, and
implemented (through means including enforcement) by the State
and which by local governments or regional agencies, or any com-
bination of local governments, regional agencies, or the State. The
implementation plan required by this part shall be prepared by an
organization certified by the State, in consultation with elected offi-
cials of local governments and in accordance with the determina-
tion under the second sentence of this subsection. Such organiza-
tion shall include elected officials of local governments in the af-
fected area, and representatives of the State air quality planning
agency, the State transportation planning agency, the metropolitan
planning organization designated to conduct the continuing, cooper-
ative and comprehensive transportation planning process for the
area under section 134 of title 23, United States Code, the organi-
zation responsible for the air quality maintenance planning process
under regulations implementing this Act, and any other organiza-
tion with responsibilities for developing, submitting, or imple-
menting the plan required by this part. Such organization may be
one that carried out these functions before the date of the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
(b) COORDINATION.—The preparation of implementation plan
provisions and subsequent plan revisions under the continuing
transportation-air quality planning process described in section
108(e) shall be coordinated with the continuing, cooperative and
comprehensive transportation planning process required under sec-
tion 134 of title 23, United States Code, and such planning proc-
esses shall take into account the requirements of this part.
(c) JOINT PLANNING.—In the case of a nonattainment area that
is included within more than one State, the affected States may
jointly, through interstate compact or otherwise, undertake and im-
plement all or part of the planning procedures described in this

(a) PLAN REVISION.—Each State which submits a request
under section 107(d) for redesignation of a nonattainment area for
any air pollutant as an area which has attained the national pri-
mary ambient air quality standard for that air pollutant shall also
submit a revision of the applicable State implementation plan to
provide for the maintenance of the national primary ambient air
quality standard for such air pollutant in the area concerned for at
least 10 years after the redesignation. The plan shall contain such
additional measures, if any, as may be necessary to ensure such
maintenance.
(b) SUBSEQUENT PLAN REVISIONS.—8 years after redesignation
of any area as an attainment area under section 107(d), the State
shall submit to the Administrator an additional revision of the ap-
plicable State implementation plan for maintaining the national
primary ambient air quality standard for 10 years after the expira-
tion of the 10-year period referred to in subsection (a).
(c) NONATTAINMENT REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE PENDING PLAN
A PPROVAL.—Until such plan revision is approved and an area is re-
designated as attainment for any area designated as a nonattain-
ment area, the requirements of this part shall continue in force and
effect with respect to such area.
(d) CONTINGENCY PROVISIONS.—Each plan revision submitted
under this section shall contain such contingency provisions as the
Administrator deems necessary to assure that the State will
promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after
the redesignation of the area as an attainment area. Such provi-
sions shall include a requirement that the State will implement all
measures with respect to the control of the air pollutant concerned
which were contained in the State implementation plan for the
area before redesignation of the area as an attainment area. The
failure of any area redesignated as an attainment area to maintain
the national ambient air quality standard concerned shall not re-
sult in a requirement that the State revise its State implementa-
tion plan unless the Administrator, in the Administrator’s discre-
tion, requires the State to submit a revised State implementation
plan.

which does not conform to an implementation plan approved or
promulgated under section 110. The assurance of conformity to
such an implementation plan shall be an affirmative responsibility
of the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality. Con-
formity to an implementation plan means—
(A) conformity to an implementation plan’s purpose of
eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations
of the national ambient air quality standards and achieving ex-
peditious attainment of such standards; and
(B) that such activities will not—
(i) cause or contribute to any new violation of any
standard in any area;
(ii) increase the frequency or severity of any existing
violation of any standard in any area; or
(iii) delay timely attainment of any standard or any
required interim emission reductions or other milestones
in any area.
The determination of conformity shall be based on the most recent
estimates of emissions, and such estimates shall be determined
from the most recent population, employment, travel and conges-
tion estimates as determined by the metropolitan planning organi-
zation or other agency authorized to make such estimates.

of the area covered by such transportation plan or program. No
Federal agency may approve, accept or fund any transportation
plan, program or project unless such plan, program or project has
been found to conform to any applicable implementation plan in ef-
fect under this Act. In particular—
(A) no transportation plan or transportation improvement
program may be adopted by a metropolitan planning organiza-
tion designated under title 23, United States Code, or the
Urban Mass Transportation Act, or be found to be in con-
formity by a metropolitan planning organization until a final
determination has been made that emissions expected from im-
plementation of such plans and programs are consistent with
estimates of emissions from motor vehicles and necessary emis-
sions reductions contained in the applicable implementation
plan, and that the plan or program will conform to the require-
ments of paragraph (1)(B);
(B) no metropolitan planning organization or other recipi-
ent of funds under title 23, United States Code, or the Urban
Mass Transportation Act shall adopt or approve a transpor-
tation improvement program of projects until it determines
that such program provides for timely implementation of trans-
portation control measures consistent with schedules included
in the applicable implementation plan;

jected for the conforming transportation plans and programs
within the nonattainment area, do not cause such plans and
programs to exceed the emission reduction projections and
schedules assigned to such plans and programs in the applica-
ble implementation plan.
(E) 73 The appropriate metropolitan planning organiza-
tion shall redetermine conformity of existing transpor-
tation plans and programs not later than 2 years after the
date on which the Administrator—
(i) finds a motor vehicle emissions budget to be
adequate in accordance with section 93.118(e)(4) of
title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on
October 1, 2004);
(ii) approves an implementation plan that estab-
lishes a motor vehicle emissions budget if that budget
has not yet been determined to be adequate in accord-
ance with clause (i); or
(iii) promulgates an implementation plan that es-
tablishes or revises a motor vehicle emissions budget.
(3) Until such time as the implementation plan revision re-
ferred to in paragraph (4)(C) is approved, conformity of such plans,
programs, and projects will be demonstrated if—
(A) the transportation plans and programs—
(i) are consistent with the most recent estimates of
mobile source emissions;
(ii) provide for the expeditious implementation of
transportation control measures in the applicable imple-
mentation plan; and
(iii) with respect to ozone and carbon monoxide non-
attainment areas, contribute to annual emissions reduc-
tions consistent with sections 182(b)(1) and 187(a)(7); and

transportation program or for the individual project taken as
a whole during the environmental review phase of project de-
velopment.
(4) CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING CON-
FORMITY.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall promulgate,
and periodically update, criteria and procedures for deter-
mining conformity (except in the case of transportation
plans, programs, and projects) of, and for keeping the Ad-
ministrator informed about, the activities referred to in
paragraph (1).
(B) TRANSPORTATION PLANS, PROGRAMS, AND
PROJECTS.—The Administrator, with the concurrence of the
Secretary of Transportation, shall promulgate, and periodi-
cally update, criteria and procedures for demonstrating
and assuring conformity in the case of transportation
plans, programs, and projects.
(C) CIVIL ACTION TO COMPEL PROMULGATION.—A civil
action may be brought against the Administrator and the
Secretary of Transportation under section 304 to compel
promulgation of such criteria and procedures and the Fed-
eral district court shall have jurisdiction to order such pro-
mulgation.
(D) The procedures and criteria shall, at a minimum—
(i) address the consultation procedures to be undertaken
by metropolitan planning organizations and the Secretary of
Transportation with State and local air quality agencies and
State departments of transportation before such organizations
and the Secretary make conformity determinations;
(ii) address the appropriate frequency for making con-
formity determinations, but the frequency for making con-
formity determinations on updated transportation plans and
programs shall be every 4 years, except in a case in which—
(I) the metropolitan planning organization elects to
update a transportation plan or program more frequently;
or (II) the metropolitan planning organization is required
to determine conformity in accordance with paragraph
(2)(E); and

(E) INCLUSION OF CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES IN SIP.—
Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the
SAFETEA–LU the procedures under subparagraph (A)
shall include a requirement that each State include in the
State implementation plan criteria and procedures for con-
sultation required by subparagraph (D)(i), and enforce-
ment and enforceability (pursuant to sections 93.125(c)
and 93.122(a)(4)(ii) of title 40, Code of Federal Regula-
tions) in accordance with the Administrator’s criteria and
procedures for consultation, enforcement and enforce-
ability.
(F) Compliance with the rules of the Administrator for deter-
mining the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and
projects funded or approved under title 23 of the United States
Code or the Federal Transit Act to State or Federal implementation
plans shall not be required for traffic signal synchronization
projects prior to the funding, approval or implementation of such
projects. The supporting regional emissions analysis for any con-
formity determination made with respect to a transportation plan,
program, or project shall consider the effect on emissions of any
such project funded, approved, or implemented prior to the con-
formity determination.
(5) 74 APPLICABILITY.—This subsection shall apply only
with respect to—
(A) a nonattainment area and each pollutant for which
the area is designated as a nonattainment area; and
(B) an area that was designated as a nonattainment
area but that was later redesignated by the Administrator
as an attainment area and that is required to develop a
maintenance plan under section 175A with respect to the
specific pollutant for which the area was designated non-
attainment.
(6) 74 Notwithstanding paragraph 5, this subsection shall
not apply with respect to an area designated nonattainment
under section 107(d)(1) until 1 year after that area is first des-
ignated nonattainment for a specific national ambient air qual-
ity standard. This paragraph only applies with respect to the
national ambient air quality standard for which an area is
newly designated nonattainment and does not affect the area’s
requirements with respect to all other national ambient air
quality standards for which the area is designated nonattain-
ment or has been redesignated from nonattainment to attain-
ment with a maintenance plan pursuant to section 175(A) (in-
cluding any pre-existing national ambient air quality standard
for a pollutant for which a new or revised standard has been
issued).
(7) CONFORMITY HORIZON FOR TRANSPORTATION PLANS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Each conformity determination re-
quired under this section for a transportation plan under
section 134(i) of title 23, United States Code, or section
5303(i) of title 49, United States Code, shall require a
demonstration of conformity for the period ending on ei-

ther the final year of the transportation plan, or at the
election of the metropolitan planning organization, after
consultation with the air pollution control agency and so-
licitation of public comments and consideration of such
comments, the longest of the following periods:
(i) The first 10-year period of any such transpor-
tation plan.
(ii) The latest year in the implementation plan ap-
plicable to the area that contains a motor vehicle
emission budget.
(iii) The year after the completion date of a region-
ally significant project if the project is included in the
transportation improvement program or the project re-
quires approval before the subsequent conformity de-
termination.
(B) REGIONAL EMISSIONS ANALYSIS.—The conformity
determination shall be accompanied by a regional emis-
sions analysis for the last year of the transportation plan
and for any year shown to exceed emission budgets by a
prior analysis, if such year extends beyond the applicable
period as determined under subparagraph (A).
(C) EXCEPTION.—In any case in which an area has a
revision to an implementation plan under section 175A(b)
and the Administrator has found the motor vehicles emis-
sions budgets from that revision to be adequate in accord-
ance with section 93.118(e)(4) of title 40, Code of Federal
Regulations (as in effect on October 1, 2004), or has ap-
proved the revision, the demonstration of conformity at the
election of the metropolitan planning organization, after
consultation with the air pollution control agency and so-
licitation of public comments and consideration of such
comments, shall be required to extend only through the
last year of the implementation plan required under sec-
tion 175A(b).
(D) EFFECT OF ELECTION.—Any election by a metro-
politan planning organization under this paragraph shall
continue in effect until the metropolitan planning organi-
zation elects otherwise.
(E) AIR POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY DEFINED.—In this
paragraph, the term ‘‘air pollution control agency’’ means
an air pollution control agency (as defined in section
302(b)) that is responsible for developing plans or control-
ling air pollution within the area covered by a transpor-
tation plan.
(8) SUBSTITUTION OF TRANSPORTATION CONTROL MEAS-
URES.— (A) I N GENERAL.—Transportation control measures
that are specified in an implementation plan may be re-
placed or added to the implementation plan with alternate
or additional transportation control measures—
(i) if the substitute measures achieve equivalent
or greater emissions reductions than the control meas-
ure to be replaced, as demonstrated with an emissions
impact analysis that is consistent with the current

measure in the implementation plan;
(ii) if the substitute control measures are imple-
mented—
(I) in accordance with a schedule that is con-
sistent with the schedule provided for control
measures in the implementation plan; or
(II) if the implementation plan date for imple-
mentation of the control measure to be replaced
has passed, as soon as practicable after the imple-
mentation plan date but not later than the date
on which emission reductions are necessary to
achieve the purpose of the implementation plan;
(iii) if the substitute and additional control meas-
ures are accompanied with evidence of adequate per-
sonnel and funding and authority under State or local
law to implement, monitor, and enforce the control
measures;
(iv) if the substitute and additional control meas-
ures were developed through a collaborative process
that included—
(I) participation by representatives of all af-
fected jurisdictions (including local air pollution
control agencies, the State air pollution control
agency, and State and local transportation agen-
cies);
(II) consultation with the Administrator; and
(III) reasonable public notice and opportunity
for comment; and
(v) if the metropolitan planning organization,
State air pollution control agency, and the Adminis-
trator concur with the equivalency of the substitute or
additional control measures.
(B) ADOPTION.—(i) Concurrence by the metropolitan
planning organization, State air pollution control agency
and the Administrator as required by subparagraph (A)(v)
shall constitute adoption of the substitute or additional
control measures so long as the requirements of subpara-
graphs (A)(i), (A)(ii), (A)(iii) and (A)(iv) are met.
(ii) Once adopted, the substitute or additional control
measures become, by operation of law, part of the State
implementation plan and become federally enforceable.
(iii) Within 90 days of its concurrence under subpara-
graph (A)(v), the State air pollution control agency shall
submit the substitute or additional control measure to the
Administrator for incorporation in the codification of the
applicable implementation plan. Nothwithstanding any
other provision of this Act, no additional State process
shall be necessary to support such revision to the applica-
ble plan.
(C) NO REQUIREMENT FOR EXPRESS PERMISSION.—The
substitution or addition of a transportation control meas-
ure in accordance with this paragraph and the funding or
approval of such a control measure shall not be contingent

on the existence of any provision in the applicable imple-
mentation plan that expressly permits such a substitution
or addition.
(D) NO REQUIREMENT FOR NEW CONFORMITY DETER-
MINATION.—The substitution or addition of a transpor-
tation control measure in accordance with this paragraph
shall not require—
(i) a new conformity determination for the trans-
portation plan; or
(ii) a revision of the implementation plan.
(E) CONTINUATION OF CONTROL MEASURE BEING RE-
PLACED.—A control measure that is being replaced by a
substitute control measure under this paragraph shall re-
main in effect until the substitute control measure is
adopted by the State pursuant to subparagraph (B).
(F) EFFECT OF ADOPTION.—Adoption of a substitute
control measure shall constitute rescission of the pre-
viously applicable control measure.
(9) LAPSE OF CONFORMITY.—If a conformity determination
required under this subsection for a transportation plan under
section 134(i) of title 23, United States Code, or section 5303(i)
of title 49, United States Code, or a transportation improve-
ment program under section 134(j) of such title 23 or under
section 5303(j) of such title 49 is not made by the applicable
deadline and such failure is not corrected by additional meas-
ures to either reduce motor vehicle emissions sufficient to dem-
onstrate compliance with the requirements of this subsection
within 12 months after such deadline or other measures suffi-
cient to correct such failures, the transportation plan shall
lapse.
(10) LAPSE.—In this subsection, the term ‘‘lapse’’ means
that the conformity determination for a transportation plan or
transportation improvement program has expired, and thus
there is no currently conforming transportation plan or trans-
portation improvement program.
(d) Each department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal
Government having authority to conduct or support any program
with air-quality related transportation consequences shall give pri-
ority in the exercise of such authority, consistent with statutory re-
quirements for allocation among States or other jurisdictions, to
the implementation of those portions of plans prepared under this
section to achieve and maintain the national primary ambient air
quality standard. This paragraph extends to, but is not limited to,
authority exercised under the Urban Mass Transportation Act, title
23 of the United States Code, and the Housing and Urban Develop-
ment Act.

ambient air quality standard in one or more other States, the Ad-
ministrator may establish, by rule, a transport region for such pol-
lutant that includes such States. The Administrator, on the Admin-
istrator’s own motion or upon petition from the Governor of any
State, or upon the recommendation of a transport commission es-
tablished under subsection (b), may—
(1) add any State or portion of a State to any region estab-
lished under this subsection whenever the Administrator has
reason to believe that the interstate transport of air pollutants
from such State significantly contributes to a violation of the
standard in the transport region, or
(2) remove any State or portion of a State from the region
whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that the con-
trol of emissions in that State or portion of the State pursuant
to this section will not significantly contribute to the attain-
ment of the standard in any area in the region.
The Administrator shall approve or disapprove any such petition or
recommendation within 18 months of its receipt. The Administrator
shall establish appropriate proceedings for public participation re-
garding such petitions and motions, including notice and comment.
(b) TRANSPORT COMMISSIONS.—
(1) ESTABLISHMENT.—Whenever the Administrator estab-
lishes a transport region under subsection (a), the Adminis-
trator shall establish a transport commission comprised of (at
a minimum) each of the following members:
(A) The Governor of each State in the region or the
designee of each such Governor.
(B) The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee.
(C) The Regional Administrator (or the Administra-
tor’s designee) for each Regional Office for each Environ-
mental Protection Agency Region affected by the transport
region concerned.
(D) An air pollution control official representing each
State in the region, appointed by the Governor.
Decisions of, and recommendations and requests to, the Ad-
ministrator by each transport commission may be made only
by a majority vote of all members other than the Administrator
and the Regional Administrators (or designees thereof).
(2) RECOMMENDATIONS.—The transport commission shall
assess the degree of interstate transport of the pollutant or
precursors to the pollutant throughout the transport region, as-
sess strategies for mitigating the interstate pollution, and rec-
ommend to the Administrator such measures as the Commis-
sion determines to be necessary to ensure that the plans for
the relevant States meet the requirements of section
110(a)(2)(D). Such commission shall not be subject to the provi-
sions of chapter 10 of title 5, United States Code.
(c) COMMISSION REQUESTS.—A transport commission estab-
lished under subsection (b) may request the Administrator to issue
a finding under section 110(k)(5) that the implementation plan for
one or more of the States in the transport region is substantially
inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D). The
Administrator shall approve, disapprove, or partially approve and
partially disapprove such a request within 18 months of its receipt

the finding under section 110(k)(5) at the time of such approval. In
acting on such request, the Administrator shall provide an oppor-
tunity for public participation and shall address each specific rec-
ommendation made by the commission. Approval or disapproval of
such a request shall constitute final agency action within the
meaning of section 307(b).

NEW MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS IN NONATTAINMENT
AREAS
S EC. 177. Notwithstanding section 209(a), any State which has
plan provisions approved under this part may adopt and enforce for
any model year standards relating to control of emissions from new
motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines and take such other
actions as are referred to in section 209(a) respecting such vehicles
if— (1) such standards are identical to the California stand-
ards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year,
and (2) California and such State adopt such standards at least
two years before commencement of such model year (as deter-
mined by regulations of the Administrator). Nothing in this
section or in title II of this Act shall be construed as author-
izing any such State to prohibit or limit, directly or indirectly,
the manufacture or sale of a new motor vehicle or motor vehi-
cle engine that is certified in California as meeting California
standards, or to take any action of any kind to create, or have
the effect of creating, a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine
different than a motor vehicle or engine certified in California
under California standards (a ‘‘third vehicle’’) or otherwise cre-
ate such a ‘‘third vehicle’’.

area designated nonattainment under section 107, based on
the submission’s failure to meet one or more of the elements
required by the provisions of this Act applicable to such an
area,
(3)(A) determines that a State has failed to make any sub-
mission as may be required under this Act, other than one de-
scribed under paragraph (1) or (2), including an adequate
maintenance plan, or has failed to make any submission, as
may be required under this Act, other than one described
under paragraph (1) or (2), that satisfies the minimum criteria
established in relation to such submission under section
110(k)(1)(A), or
(B) disapproves in whole or in part a submission described
under subparagraph (A), or
(4) finds that any requirement of an approved plan (or ap-
proved part of a plan) is not being implemented,
unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after
the finding, disapproval, or determination referred to in para-
graphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), one of the sanctions referred to in sub-
section (b) shall apply, as selected by the Administrator, until the
Administrator determines that the State has come into compliance,
except that if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith, sanc-
tions under both paragraph (1) and paragraph (2) of subsection (b)
shall apply until the Administrator determines that the State has
come into compliance. If the Administrator has selected one of such
sanctions and the deficiency has not been corrected within 6
months thereafter, sanctions under both paragraph (1) and para-
graph (2) of subsection (b) shall apply until the Administrator de-
termines that the State has come into compliance. In addition to
any other sanction applicable as provided in this section, the Ad-
ministrator may withhold all or part of the grants for support of
air pollution planning and control programs that the Administrator
may award under section 105.
(b) SANCTIONS.—The sanctions available to the Administrator
as provided in subsection (a) are as follows:
(1) HIGHWAY SANCTIONS.—(A) The Administrator may im-
pose a prohibition, applicable to a nonattainment area, on the
approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or
the awarding by the Secretary of any grants, under title 23,
United States Code, other than projects or grants for safety
where the Secretary determines, based on accident or other ap-
propriate data submitted by the State, that the principal pur-
pose of the project is an improvement in safety to resolve a
demonstrated safety problem and likely will result in a signifi-
cant reduction in, or avoidance of, accidents. Such prohibition
shall become effective upon the selection by the Administrator
of this sanction.
(B) In addition to safety, projects or grants that may be
approved by the Secretary, notwithstanding the prohibition in
subparagraph (A), are the following—
(i) capital programs for public transit;

(ii) construction or restriction of certain roads or lanes
solely for the use of passenger buses or high occupancy ve-
hicles;
(iii) planning for requirements for employers to reduce
employee work-trip-related vehicle emissions;
(iv) highway ramp metering, traffic signalization, and
related programs that improve traffic flow and achieve a
net emission reduction;
(v) fringe and transportation corridor parking facilities
serving multiple occupancy vehicle programs or transit op-
erations;
(vi) programs to limit or restrict vehicle use in down-
town areas or other areas of emission concentration par-
ticularly during periods of peak use, through road use
charges, tolls, parking surcharges, or other pricing mecha-
nisms, vehicle restricted zones or periods, or vehicle reg-
istration programs;
(vii) programs for breakdown and accident scene man-
agement, nonrecurring congestion, and vehicle information
systems, to reduce congestion and emissions; and
(viii) such other transportation-related programs as
the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of
Transportation, finds would improve air quality and would
not encourage single occupancy vehicle capacity.
In considering such measures, the State should seek to ensure
adequate access to downtown, other commercial, and residen-
tial areas, and avoid increasing or relocating emissions and
congestion rather than reducing them.
(2) OFFSETS.—In applying the emissions offset requirements of
section 173 to new or modified sources or emissions units for which
a permit is required under part D, the ratio of emission reductions
to increased emissions shall be at least 2 to 1.
(c) NOTICE OF FAILURE TO ATTAIN.—(1) As expeditiously as
practicable after the applicable attainment date for any nonattain-
ment area, but not later than 6 months after such date, the Admin-
istrator shall determine, based on the area’s air quality as of the
attainment date, whether the area attained the standard by that
date.
(2) Upon making the determination under paragraph (1), the
Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register con-
taining such determination and identifying each area that the Ad-
ministrator has determined to have failed to attain. The Adminis-
trator may revise or supplement such determination at any time
based on more complete information or analysis concerning the
area’s air quality as of the attainment date.
(d) CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILURE TO ATTAIN.—(1) Within 1 year
after the Administrator publishes the notice under subsection (c)(2)
(relating to notice of failure to attain), each State containing a non-
attainment area shall submit a revision to the applicable imple-
mentation plan meeting the requirements of paragraph (2) of this
subsection.
(2) The revision required under paragraph (1) shall meet the
requirements of section 110 and section 172. In addition, the revi-
sion shall include such additional measures as the Administrator

(a) CLASSIFICATION AND ATTAINMENT DATES FOR 1989 NON-
ATTAINMENT AREAS.—(1) Each area designated nonattainment for
ozone pursuant to section 107(d) shall be classified at the time of
such designation, under table 1, by operation of law, as a Marginal
Area, a Moderate Area, a Serious Area, a Severe Area, or an Ex-
treme Area based on the design value for the area. The design
value shall be calculated according to the interpretation method-
ology issued by the Administrator most recently before the date of
the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. For each
area classified under this subsection, the primary standard attain-
ment date for ozone shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not
later than the date provided in table 1.
TABLE 1
Area class Design value* Primary standard at-
tainment date**
Marginal ..................................... 0.121 up to 0.138 ....... 3 years after enact-
ment
Moderate .................................... 0.138 up to 0.160 ....... 6 years after enact-
ment
Serious ........................................ 0.160 up to 0.180 ....... 9 years after enact-
ment
Severe ......................................... 0.180 up to 0.280 ....... 15 years after enact-
ment
Extreme ...................................... 0.280 and above ........ 20 years after enact-
ment
*The design value is measured in parts per million (ppm).
**The primary standard attainment date is measured from the date of the en-
actment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990.
(2) Notwithstanding table 1, in the case of a severe area 78 with
a 1988 ozone design value between 0.190 and 0.280 ppm, the at-
tainment date shall be 17 years (in lieu of 15 years) after the date
of the enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990.
(3) At the time of publication of the notice under section
107(d)(4) (relating to area designations) for each ozone nonattain-
ment area, the Administrator shall publish a notice announcing the

classification of such ozone nonattainment area. The provisions of
section 172(a)(1)(B) (relating to lack of notice and comment and ju-
dicial review) shall apply to such classification.
(4) If an area classified under paragraph (1) (Table 1) would
have been classified in another category if the design value in the
area were 5 percent greater or 5 percent less than the level on
which such classification was based, the Administrator may, in the
Administrator’s discretion, within 90 days after the initial classi-
fication, by the procedure required under paragraph (3), adjust the
classification to place the area in such other category. In making
such adjustment, the Administrator may consider the number of
exceedances of the national primary ambient air quality standard
for ozone in the area, the level of pollution transport between the
area and other affected areas, including both intrastate and inter-
state transport, and the mix of sources and air pollutants in the
area.
(5) Upon application by any State, the Administrator may ex-
tend for 1 additional year (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Extension
Year’’) the date specified in table 1 of paragraph (1) of this sub-
section if—
(A) the State has complied with all requirements and com-
mitments pertaining to the area in the applicable implementa-
tion plan, and
(B) no more than 1 exceedance of the national ambient air
quality standard level for ozone has occurred in the area in the
year preceding the Extension Year.
No more than 2 one-year extensions may be issued under this
paragraph for a single nonattainment area.
(b) NEW DESIGNATIONS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS.—
(1) NEW DESIGNATIONS TO NONATTAINMENT.—Any area
that is designated attainment or unclassifiable for ozone under
section 107(d)(4), and that is subsequently redesignated to non-
attainment for ozone under section 107(d)(3), shall, at the time
of the redesignation, be classified by operation of law in accord-
ance with table 1 under subsection (a). Upon its classification,
the area shall be subject to the same requirements under sec-
tion 110, subpart 1 of this part, and this subpart that would
have applied had the area been so classified at the time of the
notice under subsection (a)(3), except that any absolute, fixed
date applicable in connection with any such requirement is ex-
tended by operation of law by a period equal to the length of
time between the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 and the date the area is classified under
this paragraph.
(2) RECLASSIFICATION UPON FAILURE TO ATTAIN.—(A) With-
in 6 months following the applicable attainment date (includ-
ing any extension thereof) for an ozone nonattainment area,
the Administrator shall determine, based on the area’s design
value (as of the attainment date), whether the area attained
the standard by that date. Except for any Severe or Extreme
area, 79 any area that the Administrator finds has not attained
the standard by that date shall be reclassified by operation of

of—
(i) the next higher classification for the area, or
(ii) the classification applicable to the area’s design
value as determined at the time of the notice required
under subparagraph (B).
No area shall be reclassified as Extreme under clause (ii).
(B) The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal
Register, no later than 6 months following the attainment
date, identifying each area that the Administrator has deter-
mined under subparagraph (A) as having failed to attain and
identifying the reclassification, if any, described under sub-
paragraph (A).
(3) VOLUNTARY RECLASSIFICATION.—The Administrator
shall grant the request of any State to reclassify a nonattain-
ment area in that State in accordance with table 1 of sub-
section (a) to a higher classification. The Administrator shall
publish a notice in the Federal Register of any such request
and of action by the Administrator granting the request.
(4) FAILURE OF SEVERE AREAS TO ATTAIN STANDARD.—(A) If
any Severe Area fails to achieve the national primary ambient
air quality standard for ozone by the applicable attainment
date (including any extension thereof), the fee provisions under
section 185 shall apply within the area, the percent reduction
requirements of section 182(c)(2)(B) and (C) (relating to reason-
able further progress demonstration and NOx control) shall
continue to apply to the area, and the State shall demonstrate
that such percent reduction has been achieved in each 3-year
interval after such failure until the standard is attained. Any
failure to make such a demonstration shall be subject to the
sanctions provided under this part.
(B) In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (A), if
the ozone design value for a Severe Area referred to in sub-
paragraph (A) is above 0.140 ppm for the year of the applicable
attainment date, or if the area has failed to achieve its most
recent milestone under section 182(g), the new source review
requirements applicable under this subpart in Extreme Areas
shall apply in the area and the term 80 ‘‘major source’’ and
‘‘major stationary source’’ shall have the same meaning as in
Extreme Areas.
(C) In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (A) for
those areas referred to in subparagraph (A) and not covered by
subparagraph (B), the provisions referred to in subparagraph
(B) shall apply after 3 years from the applicable attainment
date unless the area has attained the standard by the end of
such 3-year period.
(D) If, after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the Administrator modifies the method
of determining compliance with the national primary ambient
air quality standard, a design value or other indicator com-
parable to 0.140 in terms of its relationship to the standard

the State shall submit a revised inventory meeting the re-
quirements of subsection (a)(1).
(B) EMISSIONS STATEMENTS.—(i) Within 2 years after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, the State shall submit a revision to the
State implementation plan to require that the owner or op-
erator of each stationary source of oxides of nitrogen or
volatile organic compounds provide the State with a state-
ment, in such form as the Administrator may prescribe (or
accept an equivalent alternative developed by the State),
for classes or categories of sources, showing the actual
emissions of oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic com-
pounds from that source. The first such statement shall be
submitted within 3 years after the date of the enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Subsequent
statements shall be submitted at least every year there-
after. The statement shall contain a certification that the
information contained in the statement is accurate to the
best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement.
(ii) The State may waive the application of clause (i)
to any class or category of stationary sources which emit
less than 25 tons per year of volatile organic compounds
or oxides of nitrogen if the State, in its submissions under

The Administrator may, in the Administrator’s discretion, require
States to submit a schedule for submitting any of the revisions or
other items required under this subsection. The requirements of
this subsection shall apply in lieu of any requirement that the
State submit a demonstration that the applicable implementation
plan provides for attainment of the ozone standard by the applica-
ble attainment date in any Marginal Area. Section 172(c)(9) (relat-
ing to contingency measures) shall not apply to Marginal Areas.
(b) MODERATE AREAS.—Each State in which all or part of a
Moderate Area is located shall, with respect to the Moderate Area,
make the submissions described under subsection (a) (relating to
Marginal Areas), and shall also submit the revisions to the applica-
ble implementation plan described under this subsection.
(1) P LAN PROVISIONS FOR REASONABLE FURTHER
PROGRESS.—
(A) GENERAL RULE.—(i) By no later than 3 years after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, the State shall submit a revision to the ap-
plicable implementation plan to provide for volatile organic
compound emission reductions, within 6 years after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, of at least 15 percent from baseline emissions, ac-
counting for any growth in emissions after the year in
which the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are enacted.
Such plan shall provide for such specific annual reductions
in emissions of volatile organic compounds and oxides of
nitrogen as necessary to attain the national primary ambi-
ent air quality standard for ozone by the attainment date
applicable under this Act. This subparagraph shall not
apply in the case of oxides of nitrogen for those areas for
which the Administrator determines (when the Adminis-
trator approves the plan or plan revision) that additional
reductions of oxides of nitrogen would not contribute to at-
tainment.
(ii) A percentage less than 15 percent may be used for
purposes of clause (i) in the case of any State which dem-
onstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that—
(I) new source review provisions are applicable in
the nonattainment areas in the same manner and to
the same extent as required under subsection (e) in
the case of Extreme Areas (with the exception that, in
applying such provisions, the terms ‘‘major source’’
and ‘‘major stationary source’’ shall include (in addi-
tion to the sources described in section 302) any sta-
tionary source or group of sources located within a
contiguous area and under common control that emits,
or has the potential to emit, at least 5 tons per year
of volatile organic compounds);
(II) reasonably available control technology is re-
quired for all existing major sources (as defined in
subclause (I)); and
(III) the plan reflecting a lesser percentage than
15 percent includes all measures that can feasibly be

implemented in the area, in light of technological
achievability.
To qualify for a lesser percentage under this clause, a
State must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Adminis-
trator that the plan for the area includes the measures
that are achieved in practice by sources in the same source
category in nonattainment areas of the next higher cat-
egory.
(B) BASELINE EMISSIONS.—For purposes of subpara-
graph (A), the term ‘‘baseline emissions’’ means the total
amount of actual VOC or NOx emissions from all anthropo-
genic sources in the area during the calendar year of the
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, ex-
cluding emissions that would be eliminated under the reg-
ulations described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph
(D).
(C) GENERAL RULE FOR CREDITABILITY OF REDUC-
TIONS.—Except as provided under subparagraph (D), emis-
sions reductions are creditable toward the 15 percent re-
quired under subparagraph (A) to the extent they have ac-
tually occurred, as of 6 years after the date of the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, from the
implementation of measures required under the applicable
implementation plan, rules promulgated by the Adminis-
trator, or a permit under title V.
(D) LIMITS ON CREDITABILITY OF REDUCTIONS.—Emis-
sion reductions from the following measures are not cred-
itable toward the 15 percent reductions required under
subparagraph (A):
(i) Any measure relating to motor vehicle exhaust
or evaporative emissions promulgated by the Adminis-
trator by January 1, 1990.
(ii) Regulations concerning Reid Vapor Pressure
promulgated by the Administrator by the date of the
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
or required to be promulgated under section 211(h).
(iii) Measures required under subsection (a)(2)(A)
(concerning corrections to implementation plans pre-
scribed under guidance by the Administrator).
(iv) Measures required under subsection (a)(2)(B)
to be submitted immediately after the date of the en-
actment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(concerning corrections to motor vehicle inspection and
maintenance programs).
(2) REASONABLY AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY.—The
State shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation
plan to include provisions to require the implementation of rea-
sonably available control technology under section 172(c)(1)
with respect to each of the following:
(A) Each category of VOC sources in the area covered
by a CTG document issued by the Administrator between
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990 and the date of attainment.

(B) All VOC sources in the area covered by any CTG
issued before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990.
(C) All other major stationary sources of VOCs that
are located in the area.
Each revision described in subparagraph (A) shall be sub-
mitted within the period set forth by the Administrator in
issuing the relevant CTG document. The revisions with respect
to sources described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall be sub-
mitted by 2 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, and shall provide for the imple-
mentation of the required measures as expeditiously as prac-
ticable but no later than May 31, 1995.
(3) GASOLINE VAPOR RECOVERY.—
(A) GENERAL RULE.—Not later than 2 years after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, the State shall submit a revision to the applicable
implementation plan to require all owners or operators of
gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate, by the
date prescribed under subparagraph (B), a system for gas-
oline vapor recovery of emissions from the fueling of motor
vehicles. The Administrator shall issue guidance as appro-
priate as to the effectiveness of such system. This subpara-
graph shall apply only to facilities which sell more than
10,000 gallons of gasoline per month (50,000 gallons per
month in the case of an independent small business mar-
keter of gasoline as defined in section 325 83 ).
(B) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The date required under sub-
paragraph (A) shall be—
(i) 6 months after the adoption date, in the case
of gasoline dispensing facilities for which construction
commenced after the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990;
(ii) one year after the adoption date, in the case
of gasoline dispensing facilities which dispense at least
100,000 gallons of gasoline per month, based on aver-
age monthly sales for the 2-year period before the
adoption date; or
(iii) 2 years after the adoption date, in the case of
all other gasoline dispensing facilities.
Any gasoline dispensing facility described under both
clause (i) and clause (ii) shall meet the requirements of
clause (i).
(C) REFERENCE TO TERMS.—For purposes of this para-
graph, any reference to the term ‘‘adoption date’’ shall be
considered a reference to the date of adoption by the State
of requirements for the installation and operation of a sys-
tem for gasoline vapor recovery of emissions from the fuel-
ing of motor vehicles.

of 1990, a revision to the applicable implementation plan that
includes provisions necessary to provide for a vehicle inspec-
tion and maintenance program as described in subsection
(a)(2)(B) (without regard to whether or not the area was re-
quired by section 172(b)(11)(B) (as in effect immediately before
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990) to have included a specific schedule for implementa-
tion of such a program).
(5) GENERAL OFFSET REQUIREMENT.—For purposes of satis-
fying the emission offset requirements of this part, the ratio of
total emission reductions of volatile organic compounds to total
increase emissions of such air pollutant shall be at least 1.15
to 1.
(c) S ERIOUS AREAS.—Except as otherwise specified in para-
graph (4), each State in which all or part of a Serious Area is lo-
cated shall, with respect to the Serious Area (or portion thereof, to
the extent specified in this subsection), make the submissions de-
scribed under subsection (b) (relating to Moderate Areas), and shall
also submit the revisions to the applicable implementation plan (in-
cluding the plan items) described under this subsection. For any
Serious Area, the terms ‘‘major source’’ and ‘‘major stationary
source’’ include (in addition to the sources described in section 302)
any stationary source or group of sources located within a contig-
uous area and under common control that emits, or has the poten-
tial to emit, at least 50 tons per year of volatile organic compounds.
(1) ENHANCED MONITORING.—In order to obtain more com-
prehensive and representative data on ozone air pollution, not
later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 the Administrator shall
promulgate rules, after notice and public comment, for en-
hanced monitoring of ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and volatile or-
ganic compounds. The rules shall, among other things, cover
the location and maintenance of monitors. Immediately fol-
lowing the promulgation of rules by the Administrator relating
to enhanced monitoring, the State shall commence such actions
as may be necessary to adopt and implement a program based
on such rules, to improve monitoring for ambient concentra-
tions of ozone, oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic com-
pounds and to improve monitoring of emissions of oxides of ni-
trogen and volatile organic compounds. Each State implemen-
tation plan for the area shall contain measures to improve the
ambient monitoring of such air pollutants.
(2) ATTAINMENT AND REASONABLE FURTHER PROGRESS DEM-
ONSTRATIONS.—Within 4 years after the date of the enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the State shall sub-
mit a revision to the applicable implementation plan that in-
cludes each of the following:
(A) ATTAINMENT DEMONSTRATION.—A demonstration
that the plan, as revised, will provide for attainment of the
ozone national ambient air quality standard by the appli-
cable attainment date. This attainment demonstration
must be based on photochemical grid modeling or any
other analytical method determined by the Administrator,
in the Administrator’s discretion, to be at least as effective.

84 There should be no apostrophe.
(B) REASONABLE FURTHER PROGRESS DEMONSTRA-
TION.—A demonstration that the plan, as revised, will re-
sult in VOC emissions reductions from the baseline emis-
sions described in subsection (b)(1)(B) equal to the fol-
lowing amount averaged over each consecutive 3-year pe-
riod beginning 6 years after the date of the enactment of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, until the attain-
ment date:
(i) at least 3 percent of baseline emissions each
year; or
(ii) an amount less than 3 percent of such baseline
emissions each year, if the State demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Administrator that the plan reflect-
ing such lesser amount includes all measures that can
feasibly be implemented in the area, in light of techno-
logical achievability.
To lessen the 3 percent requirement under clause (ii), a
State must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Adminis-
trator that the plan for the area includes the measures
that are achieved in practice by sources in the same source
category in nonattainment areas of the next higher classi-
fication. Any determination to lessen the 3 percent re-
quirement shall be reviewed at each milestone under sec-
tion 182(g) and revised to reflect such new measures (if
any) achieved in practice by sources in the same category
in any State, allowing a reasonable time to implement
such measures. The emission reductions described in this
subparagraph shall be calculated in accordance with sub-
section (b)(1) (C) and (D) (concerning creditability of reduc-
tions). The reductions creditable for the period beginning
6 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990, shall include reductions that oc-
curred before such period, computed in accordance with
subsection (b)(1), that exceed the 15-percent amount of re-
ductions required under subsection (b)(1)(A).
(C) NOxCONTROL.—The revision may contain, in lieu of
the demonstration required under subparagraph (B), a
demonstration to the satisfaction of the Administrator that
the applicable implementation plan, as revised, provides
for reductions of emissions of VOC’s 84 and oxides of nitro-
gen (calculated according to the creditability provisions of
subsection (b)(1) (C) and (D)), that would result in a reduc-
tion in ozone concentrations at least equivalent to that
which would result from the amount of VOC emission re-
ductions required under subparagraph (B). Within 1 year
after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall issue guid-
ance concerning the conditions under which NOx control
may be substituted for VOC control or may be combined
with VOC control in order to maximize the reduction in
ozone air pollution. In accord with such guidance, a lesser

onstration for purposes of this subsection.
(3) ENHANCED VEHICLE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PRO-
GRAM.— (A) REQUIREMENT FOR SUBMISSION.—Within 2 years
after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the State shall submit a revision to
the applicable implementation plan to provide for an en-
hanced program to reduce hydrocarbon emissions and NOx
emissions from in-use motor vehicles registered in each ur-
banized area (in the nonattainment area), as defined by
the Bureau of the Census, with a 1980 population of
200,000 or more.
(B) EFFECTIVE DATE OF STATE PROGRAMS; GUIDANCE.—
The State program required under subparagraph (A) shall
take effect no later than 2 years from the date of the en-
actment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and
shall comply in all respects with guidance published in the
Federal Register (and from time to time revised) by the
Administrator for enhanced vehicle inspection and mainte-
nance programs. Such guidance shall include—
(i) a performance standard achievable by a pro-
gram combining emission testing, including on-road
emission testing, with inspection to detect tampering
with emission control devices and misfueling for all
light-duty vehicles and all light-duty trucks subject to
standards under section 202; and
(ii) program administration features necessary to
reasonably assure that adequate management re-
sources, tools, and practices are in place to attain and
maintain the performance standard.
Compliance with the performance standard under clause
(i) shall be determined using a method to be established by
the Administrator.
(C) S TATE PROGRAM.—The State program required
under subparagraph (A) shall include, at a minimum, each
of the following elements—
(i) Computerized emission analyzers, including on-
road testing devices.
(ii) No waivers for vehicles and parts covered by
the emission control performance warranty as pro-
vided for in section 207(b) unless a warranty remedy
has been denied in writing, or for tampering-related
repairs.
(iii) In view of the air quality purpose of the pro-
gram, if, for any vehicle, waivers are permitted for
emissions-related repairs not covered by warranty, an
expenditure to qualify for the waiver of an amount of
$450 or more for such repairs (adjusted annually as
determined by the Administrator on the basis of the
Consumer Price Index in the same manner as pro-
vided in title V).
(iv) Enforcement through denial of vehicle reg-
istration (except for any program in operation before

ments of 1990 whose enforcement mechanism is dem-
onstrated to the Administrator to be more effective
than the applicable vehicle registration program in as-
suring that noncomplying vehicles are not operated on
public roads).
(v) Annual emission testing and necessary adjust-
ment, repair, and maintenance, unless the State dem-
onstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that
a biennial inspection, in combination with other fea-
tures of the program which exceed the requirements of
this Act, will result in emission reductions which
equal or exceed the reductions which can be obtained
through such annual inspections.
(vi) Operation of the program on a centralized
basis, unless the State demonstrates to the satisfac-
tion of the Administrator that a decentralized program
will be equally effective. An electronically connected
testing system, a licensing system, or other measures
(or any combination thereof) may be considered, in ac-
cordance with criteria established by the Adminis-
trator, as equally effective for such purposes.
(vii) Inspection of emission control diagnostic sys-
tems and the maintenance or repair of malfunctions or
system deterioration identified by or affecting such
diagnostics systems.
Each State shall biennially prepare a report to the Admin-
istrator which assesses the emission reductions achieved
by the program required under this paragraph based on
data collected during inspection and repair of vehicles. The
methods used to assess the emission reductions shall be
those established by the Administrator.
(4) CLEAN-FUEL VEHICLE PROGRAMS.—(A) Except to the ex-
tent that substitute provisions have been approved by the Ad-
ministrator under subparagraph (B), the State shall submit to
the Administrator, within 42 months of the date of the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a revision to
the applicable implementation plan for each area described
under part C of title II to include such measures as may be
necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the applicable provi-
sions of the clean-fuel vehicle program prescribed under part
C of title II, including all measures necessary to make the use
of clean alternative fuels in clean-fuel vehicles (as defined in
part C of title II) economic from the standpoint of vehicle own-
ers. Such a revision shall also be submitted for each area that
opts into the clean fuel-vehicle program as provided in part C
of title II.
(B) The Administrator shall approve, as a substitute for all
or a portion of the clean-fuel vehicle program prescribed under
part C of title II, any revision to the relevant applicable imple-
mentation plan that in the Administrator’s judgment will
achieve long-term reductions in ozone-producing and toxic air
emissions equal to those achieved under part C of title II, or
the percentage thereof attributable to the portion of the clean-

fuel vehicle program for which the revision is to substitute.
The Administrator may approve such revision only if it consists
exclusively of provisions other than those required under this
Act for the area. Any State seeking approval of such revision
must submit the revision to the Administrator within 24
months of the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990. The Administrator shall approve or dis-
approve any such revision within 30 months of the date of the
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Ad-
ministrator shall publish the revision submitted by a State in
the Federal Register upon receipt. Such notice shall constitute
a notice of proposed rulemaking on whether or not to approve
such revision and shall be deemed to comply with the require-
ments concerning notices of proposed rulemaking contained in
sections 553 through 557 of title 5 of the United States Code
(related to notice and comment). Where the Administrator ap-
proves such revision for any area, the State need not submit
the revision required by subparagraph (A) for the area with re-
spect to the portions of the Federal clean-fuel vehicle program
for which the Administrator has approved the revision as a
substitute.
(C) If the Administrator determines, under section 179,
that the State has failed to submit any portion of the program
required under subparagraph (A), then, in addition to any
sanctions available under section 179, the State may not re-
ceive credit, in any demonstration of attainment or reasonable
further progress for the area, for any emission reductions from
implementation of the corresponding aspects of the Federal
clean-fuel vehicle requirements established in part C of title II.
(5) TRANSPORTATION CONTROL.—(A) 85 Beginning 6 years
after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990 and each third year thereafter, the State shall
submit a demonstration as to whether current aggregate vehi-
cle mileage, aggregate vehicle emissions, congestion levels, and
other relevant parameters are consistent with those used for
the area’s demonstration of attainment. Where such param-
eters and emissions levels exceed the levels projected for pur-
poses of the area’s attainment demonstration, the State shall
within 18 months develop and submit a revision of the applica-
ble implementation plan that includes a transportation control
measures program consisting of measures from, but not limited
to, section 108(f) that will reduce emissions to levels that are
consistent with emission levels projected in such demonstra-
tion. In considering such measures, the State should ensure
adequate access to downtown, other commercial, and residen-
tial areas and should avoid measures that increase or relocate
emissions and congestion rather than reduce them. Such revi-
sion shall be developed in accordance with guidance issued by
the Administrator pursuant to section 108(e) and with the re-
quirements of section 174(b) and shall include implementation

and funding schedules that achieve expeditious emissions re-
ductions in accordance with implementation plan projections.
(6) DE MINIMIS RULE.—The new source review provisions
under this part shall ensure that increased emissions of vola-
tile organic compounds resulting from any physical change in,
or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source lo-
cated in the area shall not be considered de minimis for pur-
poses of determining the applicability of the permit require-
ments established by this Act unless the increase in net emis-
sions of such air pollutant from such source does not exceed 25
tons when aggregated with all other net increases in emissions
from the source over any period of 5 consecutive calendar years
which includes the calendar year in which such increase oc-
curred.
(7) SPECIAL RULE FOR MODIFICATIONS OF SOURCES EMIT-
TING LESS THAN 100 TONS.—In the case of any major stationary
source of volatile organic compounds located in the area (other
than a source which emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons
or more of volatile organic compounds per year), whenever any
change (as described in section 111(a)(4)) at that source results
in any increase (other than a de minimis increase) in emissions
of volatile organic compounds from any discrete operation,
unit, or other pollutant emitting activity at the source, such in-
crease shall be considered a modification for purposes of sec-
tion 172(c)(5) and section 173(a), except that such increase
shall not be considered a modification for such purposes if the
owner or operator of the source elects to offset the increase by
a greater reduction in emissions of volatile organic compounds
concerned from other operations, units, or activities within the
source at an internal offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 1. If the
owner or operator does not make such election, such change
shall be considered a modification for such purposes, but in ap-
plying section 173(a)(2) in the case of any such modification,
the best available control technology (BACT), as defined in sec-
tion 169, shall be substituted for the lowest achievable emis-
sion rate (LAER). The Administrator shall establish and pub-
lish policies and procedures for implementing the provisions of
this paragraph.
(8) SPECIAL RULE FOR MODIFICATIONS OF SOURCES EMIT-
TING 100 TONS OR MORE.—In the case of any major stationary
source of volatile organic compounds located in the area which
emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons or more of volatile
organic compounds per year, whenever any change (as de-
scribed in section 111(a)(4)) at that source results in any in-
crease (other than a de minimis increase) in emissions of vola-
tile organic compounds from any discrete operation, unit, or
other pollutant emitting activity at the source, such increase
shall be considered a modification for purposes of section
172(c)(5) and section 173(a), except that if the owner or oper-
ator of the source elects to offset the increase by a greater re-
duction in emissions of volatile organic compounds from other
operations, units, or activities within the source at an internal
offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 1, the requirements of section

gency provisions required under section 172(c)(9), the plan re-
vision shall provide for the implementation of specific meas-
ures to be undertaken if the area fails to meet any applicable
milestone. Such measures shall be included in the plan revi-
sion as contingency measures to take effect without further ac-
tion by the State or the Administrator upon a failure by the
State to meet the applicable milestone.
(10) GENERAL OFFSET REQUIREMENT.—For purposes of sat-
isfying the emission offset requirements of this part, the ratio
of total emission reductions of volatile organic compounds to
total increase emissions of such air pollutant shall be at least
1.2 to 1.
Any reference to ‘‘attainment date’’ in subsection (b), which is in-
corporated by reference into this subsection, shall refer to the at-
tainment date for serious areas. 86
(d) SEVERE AREAS.—Each State in which all or part of a Severe
Area is located shall, with respect to the Severe Area, make the
submissions described under subsection (c) (relating to Serious
Areas), and shall also submit the revisions to the applicable imple-
mentation plan (including the plan items) described under this sub-
section. For any Severe Area, the terms ‘‘major source’’ and ‘‘major
stationary source’’ include (in addition to the sources described in
section 302) any stationary source or group of sources located with-
in a contiguous area and under common control that emits, or has
the potential to emit, at least 25 tons per year of volatile organic
compounds.
(1) VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED.—(A) Within 2 years after the
date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
the State shall submit a revision that identifies and adopts
specific enforceable transportation control strategies and trans-
portation control measures to offset any growth in emissions
from growth in vehicle miles traveled or numbers of vehicle
trips in such area and to attain reduction in motor vehicle
emissions as necessary, in combination with other emission re-
duction requirements of this subpart, to comply with the re-
quirements of subsection (b)(2)(B) 87 and (c)(2)(B) (pertaining to
periodic emissions reduction requirements). The State shall
consider measures specified in section 108(f), and choose from
among and implement such measures as necessary to dem-
onstrate attainment with the national ambient air quality
standards; in considering such measures, the State should en-
sure adequate access to downtown, other commercial, and resi-
dential areas and should avoid measures that increase or relo-
cate emissions and congestion rather than reduce them.
(B) The State may also, in its discretion, submit a revision
at any time requiring employers in such area to implement
programs to reduce work-related vehicle trips and miles trav-
elled by employees. Such revision shall be developed in accord-

section 108(f) and may require that employers in such area in-
crease average passenger occupancy per vehicle in commuting
trips between home and the workplace during peak travel peri-
ods. The guidance of the Administrator may specify average ve-
hicle occupancy rates which vary for locations within a non-
attainment area (suburban, center city, business district) or
among nonattainment areas reflecting existing occupancy rates
and the availability of high occupancy modes. Any State re-
quired to submit a revision under this subparagraph (as in ef-
fect before the date of enactment of this sentence) containing
provisions requiring employers to reduce work-related vehicle
trips and miles travelled by employees may, in accordance with
State law, remove such provisions from the implementation
plan, or withdraw its submission, if the State notifies the Ad-
ministrator, in writing, that the State has undertaken, or will
undertake, one or more alternative methods that will achieve
emission reductions equivalent to those to be achieved by the
removed or withdrawn provisions.
(2) OFFSET REQUIREMENT.—For purposes of satisfying the
offset requirements pursuant to this part, the ratio of total
emission reductions of VOCs to total increased emissions of
such air pollutant shall be at least 1.3 to 1, except that if the
State plan requires all existing major sources in the nonattain-
ment area to use best available control technology (as defined
in section 169(3)) for the control of volatile organic compounds,
the ratio shall be at least 1.2 to 1.
(3) ENFORCEMENT UNDER SECTION 185.—By December 31,
2000, the State shall submit a plan revision which includes the
provisions required under section 185.
Any reference to the term ‘‘attainment date’’ in subsection (b) or (c),
which is incorporated by reference into this subsection (d), shall
refer to the attainment date for Severe Areas.
(e) EXTREME AREAS.—Each State in which all or part of an Ex-
treme Area is located shall, with respect to the Extreme Area,
make the submissions described under subsection (d) (relating to
Severe Areas), and shall also submit the revisions to the applicable
implementation plan (including the plan items) described under
this subsection. The provisions of clause (ii) of subsection (c)(2)(B)
(relating to reductions of less than 3 percent), the provisions of
paragaphs 88 (6), (7) and (8) of subsection (c) (relating to de mini-
mus rule and modification of sources), and the provisions of clause
(ii) of subsection (b)(1)(A) (relating to reductions of less than 15
percent) shall not apply in the case of an Extreme Area. For any
Extreme Area, the terms ‘‘major source’’ and ‘‘major stationary
source’’ includes (in addition to the sources described in section
302) any stationary source or group of sources located within a con-
tiguous area and under common control that emits, or has the po-
tential to emit, at least 10 tons per year of volatile organic com-
pounds. (1) OFFSET REQUIREMENT.—For purposes of satisfying the

the ratio shall be at least 1.2 to 1.
(2) MODIFICATIONS—Any change (as described in section
111(a)(4)) at a major stationary source which results in any in-
crease in emissions from any discrete operation, unit, or other
pollutant emitting activity at the source shall be considered a
modification for purposes of section 172(c)(5) and section
173(a), except that for purposes of complying with the offset re-
quirement pursuant to section 173(a)(1), any such increase
shall not be considered a modification if the owner or operator
of the source elects to offset the increase by a greater reduction
in emissions of the air pollutant concerned from other discrete
operations, units, or activities within the source at an internal
offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 1. The offset requirements of this
part shall not be applicable in Extreme Areas to a modification
of an existing source if such modification consists of installa-
tion of equipment required to comply with the applicable im-
plementation plan, permit, or this Act.
(3) USE OF CLEAN FUELS OR ADVANCED CONTROL TECH-
NOLOGY.—For Extreme Areas, a plan revision shall be sub-
mitted within 3 years after the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to require, effective 8 years
after such date, that each new, modified, and existing electric
utility and industrial and commercial boiler which emits more
than 25 tons per year of oxides of nitrogen—
(A) burn as its primary fuel natural gas, methanol, or
ethanol (or a comparably low polluting fuel), or
(B) use advanced control technology (such as catalytic
control technology or other comparably effective control
methods) for reduction of emissions of oxides of nitrogen.
For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘primary fuel’’ means
the fuel which is used 90 percent or more of the operating
time. This paragraph shall not apply during any natural gas
supply emergency (as defined in title III of the Natural Gas
Policy Act of 1978).
(4) TRAFFIC CONTROL MEASURES DURING HEAVY TRAFFIC
HOURS.—For Extreme Areas, each implementation plan revi-
sion under this subsection may contain provisions establishing
traffic control measures applicable during heavy traffic hours
to reduce the use of high polluting vehicles or heavy-duty vehi-
cles, notwithstanding any other provision of law.
(5) N EW TECHNOLOGIES.—The Administrator may, in ac-
cordance with section 110, approve provisions of an implemen-
tation plan for an Extreme Area which anticipate development
of new control techniques or improvement of existing control
technologies, and an attainment demonstration based on such
provisions, if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Administrator that—
(A) such provisions are not necessary to achieve the
incremental emission reductions required during the first

10 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990; and
(B) the State has submitted enforceable commitments
to develop and adopt contingency measures to be imple-
mented as set forth herein if the anticipated technologies
do not achieve planned reductions.
Such contingency measures shall be submitted to the Adminis-
trator no later than 3 years before proposed implementation of
the plan provisions and approved or disapproved by the Ad-
ministrator in accordance with section 110. The contingency
measures shall be adequate to produce emission reductions
sufficient, in conjunction with other approved plan provisions,
to achieve the periodic emission reductions required by sub-
section (b)(1) or (c)(2) and attainment by the applicable dates.
If the Administrator determines that an Extreme Area has
failed to achieve an emission reduction requirement set forth
in subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2), and that such failure is due in
whole or part to an inability to fully implement provisions ap-
proved pursuant to this subsection, the Administrator shall re-
quire the State to implement the contingency measures to the
extent necessary to assure compliance with subsections (b)(1)
and (c)(2).
Any reference to the term ‘‘attainment date’’ in subsection (b), (c),
or (d) which is incorporated by reference into this subsection, shall
refer to the attainment date for Extreme Areas.
(f) NOxREQUIREMENTS.—(1) The plan provisions required under
this subpart for major stationary sources of volatile organic com-
pounds shall also apply to major stationary sources (as defined in
section 302 and subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section) of oxides
of nitrogen. This subsection shall not apply in the case of oxides of
nitrogen for those sources for which the Administrator determines
(when the Administrator approves a plan or plan revision) that net
air quality benefits are greater in the absence of reductions of ox-
ides of nitrogen from the sources concerned. This subsection shall
also not apply in the case of oxides of nitrogen for—
(A) nonattainment areas not within an ozone transport re-
gion under section 184 if the Administrator determines (when
the Administrator approves a plan or plan revision) that addi-
tional reductions of oxides of nitrogen would not contribute to
attainment of the national ambient air quality standard for
ozone in the area, or
(B) nonattainment areas within such an ozone transport
region if the Administrator determines (when the Adminis-
trator approves a plan or plan revision) that additional reduc-
tions of oxides of nitrogen would not produce net ozone air
quality benefits in such region.
The Administrator shall, in the Administrator’s determinations,
consider the study required under section 185B.
(2)(A) If the Administrator determines that excess reductions
in emissions of NOx would be achieved under paragraph (1), the
Administrator may limit the application of paragraph (1) to the ex-
tent necessary to avoid achieving such excess reductions.
(B) For purposes of this paragraph, excess reductions in emis-
sions of NOx are emission reductions for which the Administrator

determines that net air quality benefits are greater in the absence
of such reductions. Alternatively, for purposes of this paragraph,
excess reductions in emissions of NOx are, for—
(i) nonattainment areas not within an ozone transport re-
gion under section 184, emission reductions that the Adminis-
trator determines would not contribute to attainment of the
national ambient air quality standard for ozone in the area, or
(ii) nonattainment areas within such ozone transport re-
gion, emission reductions that the Administrator determines
would not produce net ozone air quality benefits in such re-
gion.
(3) At any time after the final report under section 185B is
submitted to Congress, a person may petition the Administrator for
a determination under paragraph (1) or (2) with respect to any
nonattainment area or any ozone transport region under section
184. The Administrator shall grant or deny such petition within 6
months after its filing with the Administrator.
(g) M ILESTONES.—
(1) REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS.—6 years after the date of
the enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 and at in-
tervals of every 3 years thereafter, the State shall determine
whether each nonattainment area (other than an area classi-
fied as Marginal or Moderate) has achieved a reduction in
emissions during the preceding intervals equivalent to the
total emission reductions required to be achieved by the end of
such interval pursuant to subsection (b)(1) and the cor-
responding requirements of subsections (c)(2) (B) and (C), (d),
and (e). Such reduction shall be referred to in this section as
an applicable milestone.
(2) COMPLIANCE DEMONSTRATION.—For each nonattain-
ment area referred to in paragraph (1), not later than 90 days
after the date on which an applicable milestone occurs (not in-
cluding an attainment date on which a milestone occurs in
cases where the standard has been attained), each State in
which all or part of such area is located shall submit to the Ad-
ministrator a demonstration that the milestone has been met.
A demonstration under this paragraph shall be submitted in
such form and manner, and shall contain such information and
analysis, as the Administrator shall require, by rule. The Ad-
ministrator shall determine whether or not a State’s dem-
onstration is adequate within 90 days after the Administrator’s
receipt of a demonstration which contains the information and
analysis required by the Administrator.
(3) SERIOUS AND SEVERE AREAS; STATE ELECTION.—If a
State fails to submit a demonstration under paragraph (2) for
any Serious or Severe Area within the required period or if the
Administrator determines that the area has not met any appli-
cable milestone, the State shall elect, within 90 days after such
failure or determination—
(A) to have the area reclassified to the next higher
classification,
(B) to implement specific additional measures ade-
quate, as determined by the Administrator, to meet the

next milestone as provided in the applicable contingency
plan, or
(C) to adopt an economic incentive program as de-
scribed in paragraph (4).
If the State makes an election under subparagraph (B), the Ad-
ministrator shall, within 90 days after the election, review
such plan and shall, if the Administrator finds the contingency
plan inadequate, require further measures necessary to meet
such milestone. Once the State makes an election, it shall be
deemed accepted by the Administrator as meeting the election
requirement. If the State fails to make an election required
under this paragraph within the required 90-day period or
within 6 months thereafter, the area shall be reclassified to the
next higher classification by operation of law at the expiration
of such 6-month period. Within 12 months after the date re-
quired for the State to make an election, the State shall submit
a revision of the applicable implementation plan for the area
that meets the requirements of this paragraph. The Adminis-
trator shall review such plan revision and approve or dis-
approve the revision within 9 months after the date of its sub-
mission.
(4) ECONOMIC INCENTIVE PROGRAM.—(A) An economic in-
centive program under this paragraph shall be consistent with
rules published by the Administrator and sufficient, in com-
bination with other elements of the State plan, to achieve the
next milestone. The State program may include a nondiscrim-
inatory system, consistent with applicable law regarding inter-
state commerce, of State established emissions fees or a system
of marketable permits, or a system of State fees on sale or
manufacture of products the use of which contributes to ozone
formation, or any combination of the foregoing or other similar
measures. The program may also include incentives and re-
quirements to reduce vehicle emissions and vehicle miles trav-
eled in the area, including any of the transportation control
measures identified in section 108(f).
(B) Within 2 years after the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall
publish rules for the programs to be adopted pursuant to sub-
paragraph (A). Such rules shall include model plan provisions
which may be adopted for reducing emissions from permitted
stationary sources, area sources, and mobile sources. The
guidelines shall require that any revenues generated by the
plan provisions adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be
used by the State for any of the following:
(i) Providing incentives for achieving emission reduc-
tions.
(ii) Providing assistance for the development of inno-
vative technologies for the control of ozone air pollution
and for the development of lower-polluting solvents and
surface coatings. Such assistance shall not provide for the
payment of more than 75 percent of either the costs of any
project to develop such a technology or the costs of devel-
opment of a lower-polluting solvent or surface coating.

(iii) Funding the administrative costs of State pro-
grams under this Act. Not more than 50 percent of such
revenues may be used for purposes of this clause.
(5) EXTREME AREAS.—If a State fails to submit a dem-
onstration under paragraph (2) for any Extreme Area within
the required period, or if the Administrator determines that
the area has not met any applicable milestone, the State shall,
within 9 months after such failure or determination, submit a
plan revision to implement an economic incentive program
which meets the requirements of paragraph (4). The Adminis-
trator shall review such plan revision and approve or dis-
approve the revision within 9 months after the date of its sub-
mission.
(h) RURAL TRANSPORT AREAS.—(1) Notwithstanding any other
provision of section 181 or this section, a State containing an ozone
nonattainment area that does not include, and is not adjacent to,
any part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area or, where one exists, a
Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (as defined by the
United States Bureau of the Census), which area is treated by the
Administrator, in the Administrator’s discretion, as a rural trans-
port area within the meaning of paragraph (2), shall be treated by
operation of law as satisfying the requirements of this section if it
makes the submissions required under subsection (a) of this section
(relating to marginal areas 89 ).
(2) The Administrator may treat an ozone nonattainment area
as a rural transport area if the Administrator finds that sources of
VOC (and, where the Administrator determines relevant, NOx)
emissions within the area do not make a significant contribution to
the ozone concentrations measured in the area or in other areas.
(i) RECLASSIFIED AREAS.—Each State containing an ozone non-
attainment area reclassified under section 181(b)(2) shall meet
such requirements of subsections (b) through (d) of this section as
may be applicable to the area as reclassified, according to the
schedules prescribed in connection with such requirements, except
that the Administrator may adjust any applicable deadlines (other
than attainment dates) to the extent such adjustment is necessary
or appropriate to assure consistency among the required submis-
sions.
(j) MULTI-STATE OZONE NONATTAINMENT AREAS.—
(1) COORDINATION AMONG STATES.—Each State in which
there is located a portion of a single ozone nonattainment area
which covers more than one State (hereinafter in this section
referred to as a ‘‘multi-State ozone nonattainment area’’)
shall—
(A) take all reasonable steps to coordinate, sub-
stantively and procedurally, the revisions and implementa-
tion of State implementation plans applicable to the non-
attainment area concerned; and
(B) use photochemical grid modeling or any other ana-
lytical method determined by the Administrator, in his dis-
cretion, to be at least as effective.

plementation plan submitted under this part for a State in
which part of a multi-State ozone nonattainment area is lo-
cated if the plan revision for that State fails to comply with the

(2) FAILURE TO DEMONSTRATE ATTAINMENT.—If any State
in which there is located a portion of a multi-State ozone non-
attainment area fails to provide a demonstration of attainment
of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone in that
portion within the required period, the State may petition the
Administrator to make a finding that the State would have
been able to make such demonstration but for the failure of
one or more other States in which other portions of the area
are located to commit to the implementation of all measures
required under section 182 (relating to plan submissions and
requirements for ozone nonattainment areas). If the Adminis-
trator makes such finding, the provisions of section 179 (relat-
ing to sanctions) shall not apply, by reason of the failure to
make such demonstration, in the portion of the multi-State
ozone nonattainment area within the State submitting such
petition.

(a) CONTROL TECHNIQUES GUIDELINES FOR VOC SOURCES.—
Within 3 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall issue control tech-
niques guidelines, in accordance with section 108, for 11 categories
of stationary sources of VOC emissions for which such guidelines
have not been issued as of such date of enactment, not including
the categories referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection
(b) of this section. The Administrator may issue such additional
control techniques guidelines as the Administrator deems nec-
essary.
(b) EXISTING AND NEW CTGS.—(1) Within 36 months after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
and periodically thereafter, the Administrator shall review and, if
necessary, update control technique guidance issued under section
108 before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990.
(2) In issuing the guidelines the Administrator shall give pri-
ority to those categories which the Administrator considers to make
the most significant contribution to the formation of ozone air pol-
lution in ozone nonattainment areas, including hazardous waste
treatment, storage, and disposal facilities which are permitted
under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Thereafter the
Administrator shall periodically review and, if necessary, revise
such guidelines.
(3) Within 3 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall issue control
techniques guidelines in accordance with section 108 to reduce the
aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds into the ambient
air from aerospace coatings and solvents. Such control techniques
guidelines shall, at a minimum, be adequate to reduce aggregate

emissions of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from
the application of such coatings and solvents to such level as the
Administrator determines may be achieved through the adoption of
best available control measures. Such control technology guidance
shall provide for such reductions in such increments and on such
schedules as the Administrator determines to be reasonable, but in
no event later than 10 years after the final issuance of such control
technology guidance. In developing control technology guidance
under this subsection, the Administrator shall consult with the
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Ad-
ministrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
with regard to the establishment of specifications for such coatings.
In evaluating VOC reduction strategies, the guidance shall take
into account the applicable requirements of section 112 and the
need to protect stratospheric ozone.
(4) Within 3 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall issue control
techniques guidelines in accordance with section 108 to reduce the
aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds and PM–10 into
the ambient air from paints, coatings, and solvents used in ship-
building operations and ship repair. Such control techniques guide-
lines shall, at a minimum, be adequate to reduce aggregate emis-
sions of volatile organic compounds and PM–10 into the ambient
air from the removal or application of such paints, coatings, and
solvents to such level as the Administrator determines may be
achieved through the adoption of the best available control meas-
ures. Such control techniques guidelines shall provide for such re-
ductions in such increments and on such schedules as the Adminis-
trator determines to be reasonable, but in no event later than 10
years after the final issuance of such control technology guidance.
In developing control techniques guidelines under this subsection,
the Administrator shall consult with the appropriate Federal agen-
cies.(c) ALTERNATIVE CONTROL TECHNIQUES.—Within 3 years after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, the Administrator shall issue technical documents which
identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources
of volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen which emit, or
have the potential to emit 25 tons per year or more of such air pol-
lutant. The Administrator shall revise and update such documents
as the Administrator determines necessary.
(d) GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATING COST-EFFECTIVENESS.—Within
1 year after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, the Administrator shall provide guidance to the
States to be used in evaluating the relative cost-effectiveness of
various options for the control of emissions from existing stationary
sources of air pollutants which contribute to nonattainment of the
national ambient air quality standards for ozone.
(e) CONTROL OF EMISSIONS FROM CERTAIN SOURCES.—
(1) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this subsection—
(A) BEST AVAILABLE CONTROLS.—The term ‘‘best avail-
able controls’’ means the degree of emissions reduction
that the Administrator determines, on the basis of techno-
logical and economic feasibility, health, environmental,

and energy impacts, is achievable through the application
of the most effective equipment, measures, processes,
methods, systems or techniques, including chemical refor-
mulation, product or feedstock substitution, repackaging,
and directions for use, consumption, storage, or disposal.
(B) CONSUMER OR COMMERCIAL PRODUCT.—The term
‘‘consumer or commercial product’’ means any substance,
product (including paints, coatings, and solvents), or arti-
cle (including any container or packaging) held by any per-
son, the use, consumption, storage, disposal, destruction,
or decomposition of which may result in the release of
volatile organic compounds. The term does not include
fuels or fuel additives regulated under section 211, or
motor vehicles, non-road vehicles, and non-road engines as
defined under section 216.
(C) REGULATED ENTITIES.—The term ‘‘regulated enti-
ties’’ means—
(i) manufacturers, processors, wholesale distribu-
tors, or importers of consumer or commercial products
for sale or distribution in interstate commerce in the
United States; or
(ii) manufacturers, processors, wholesale distribu-
tors, or importers that supply the entities listed under
clause (i) with such products for sale or distribution in
interstate commerce in the United States.
(2) STUDY AND REPORT.—
(A) S TUDY.—The Administrator shall conduct a study
of the emissions of volatile organic compounds into the am-
bient air from consumer and commercial products (or any
combination thereof) in order to—
(i) determine their potential to contribute to ozone
levels which violate the national ambient air quality
standard for ozone; and
(ii) establish criteria for regulating consumer and
commercial products or classes or categories thereof
which shall be subject to control under this subsection.
The study shall be completed and a report submitted to
Congress not later than 3 years after the date of the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
(B) CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN FACTORS.—In estab-
lishing the criteria under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Admin-
istrator shall take into consideration each of the following:
(i) The uses, benefits, and commercial demand of
consumer and commercial products.
(ii) The health or safety functions (if any) served
by such consumer and commercial products.
(iii) Those consumer and commercial products
which emit highly reactive volatile organic compounds
into the ambient air.
(iv) Those consumer and commercial products
which are subject to the most cost-effective controls.

parable costs, considering health, safety, and environ-
mental impacts.
(3) REGULATIONS TO REQUIRE EMISSION REDUCTIONS.—
(A) I N GENERAL.—Upon submission of the final report
under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall list those cat-
egories of consumer or commercial products that the Ad-
ministrator determines, based on the study, account for at
least 80 percent of the VOC emissions, on a reactivity-ad-
justed basis, from consumer or commercial products in
areas that violate the NAAQS for ozone. Credit toward the
80 percent emissions calculation shall be given for emis-
sion reductions from consumer or commercial products
made after the date of enactment of this section. At such
time, the Administrator shall divide the list into 4 groups
establishing priorities for regulation based on the criteria
established in paragraph (2). Every 2 years after promul-
gating such list, the Administrator shall regulate one
group of categories until all 4 groups are regulated. The
regulations shall require best available controls as defined
in this section. Such regulations may exempt health use
products for which the Administrator determines there is
no suitable substitute. In order to carry out this section,
the Administrator may, by regulation, control or prohibit
any activity, including the manufacture or introduction
into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any consumer
or commercial product which results in emission of volatile
organic compounds into the ambient air.
(B) REGULATED ENTITIES.—Regulations under this sub-
section may be imposed only with respect to regulated en-
tities.
(C) USE OF CTGS.—For any consumer or commercial
product the Administrator may issue control techniques
guidelines under this Act in lieu of regulations required
under subparagraph (A) if the Administrator determines
that such guidance will be substantially as effective as reg-
ulations in reducing emissions of volatile organic com-
pounds which contribute to ozone levels in areas which
violate the national ambient air quality standard for
ozone.
(4) SYSTEMS OF REGULATION.—The regulations under this
subsection may include any system or systems of regulation as
the Administrator may deem appropriate, including require-
ments for registration and labeling, self-monitoring and report-
ing, prohibitions, limitations, or economic incentives (including
marketable permits and auctions of emissions rights) con-
cerning the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, con-
sumption, or disposal of the product.
(5) SPECIAL FUND.—Any amounts collected by the Adminis-
trator under such regulations shall be deposited in a special
fund in the United States Treasury for licensing and other
services, which thereafter shall be available until expended,
subject to annual appropriation Acts, solely to carry out the ac-
tivities of the Administrator for which such fees, charges, or
collections are established or made.

subsection shall be treated, for purposes of enforcement of this
Act, as a standard under section 111 and any violation of such
regulation shall be treated as a violation of a requirement of
section 111(e).
(7) STATE ADMINISTRATION.—Each State may develop and
submit to the Administrator a procedure under State law for
implementing and enforcing regulations promulgated under
this subsection. If the Administrator finds the State procedure
is adequate, the Administrator shall approve such procedure.
Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit the Administrator
from enforcing any applicable regulations under this sub-
section.
(8) SIZE, ETC.—No regulations regarding the size, shape, or
labeling of a product may be promulgated, unless the Adminis-
trator determines such regulations to be useful in meeting any
national ambient air quality standard.
(9) STATE CONSULTATION.—Any State which proposes regu-
lations other than those adopted under this subsection shall
consult with the Administrator regarding whether any other
State or local subdivision has promulgated or is promulgating
regulations on any products covered under this part. The Ad-
ministrator shall establish a clearinghouse of information,
studies, and regulations proposed and promulgated regarding
products covered under this subsection and disseminate such
information collected as requested by State or local subdivi-
sions.
(f) TANK VESSEL STANDARDS.—
(1) SCHEDULE FOR STANDARDS.—(A) Within 2 years after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary
of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall
promulgate standards applicable to the emission of VOCs and
any other air pollutant from loading and unloading of tank ves-
sels (as that term is defined in section 2101 of title 46 of the
United States Code) which the Administrator finds causes, or
contributes to, air pollution that may be reasonably anticipated
to endanger public health or welfare. Such standards shall re-
quire the application of reasonably available control tech-
nology, considering costs, any nonair-quality benefits, environ-
mental impacts, energy requirements and safety factors associ-

ulations.
(2) REGULATIONS ON EQUIPMENT SAFETY.—Within 6
months after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the Secretary of the Department in
which the Coast Guard is operating shall issue regulations to
ensure the safety of the equipment and operations which are
to control emissions from the loading and unloading of tank
vessels, under section 3703 of title 46 of the United States
Code and section 6 of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (33
U.S.C. 1225). The standards promulgated by the Administrator
under paragraph (1) and the regulations issued by a State or
political subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and
unloading of tank vessels shall be consistent with the regula-
tions regarding safety of the Department in which the Coast
Guard is operating.
(3) AGENCY AUTHORITY.—(A) The Administrator shall en-
sure compliance with the tank vessel emission standards pre-
scribed under paragraph (1)(A). The Secretary of the Depart-
ment in which the Coast Guard is operating shall also ensure
compliance with the tank vessel standards prescribed under
paragraph (1)(A).
(B) The Secretary of the Department in which the Coast
Guard is operating shall ensure compliance with the regula-
tions issued under paragraph (2).
(4) STATE OR LOCAL STANDARDS.—After the Administrator
promulgates standards under this section, no State or political
subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any stand-
ard respecting emissions from tank vessels subject to regula-
tion under paragraph (1) unless such standard is no less strin-
gent than the standards promulgated under paragraph (1).
(5) ENFORCEMENT.—Any standard established under para-
graph (1)(A) shall be treated, for purposes of enforcement of
this Act, as a standard under section 111 and any violation of
such standard shall be treated as a violation of a requirement
of section 111(e).
(g) OZONE DESIGN VALUE STUDY.—The Administrator shall
conduct a study of whether the methodology in use by the Environ-
mental Protection Agency as of the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for establishing a design value
for ozone provides a reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality
of ozone nonattainment areas. The Administrator shall obtain
input from States, local subdivisions thereof, and others. The study
shall be completed and a report submitted to Congress not later
than 3 years after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990. The results of the study shall be subject to
peer and public review before submitting it to Congress.

ing controls contained in section 182(b)(3), and such measures or
such vehicle refueling controls shall be implemented in accordance
with the provisions of this section. Notwithstanding other deadlines
in this section, the applicable implementation plan shall be revised
to reflect such measures within 1 year of completion of the study.
For purposes of this section any stationary source that emits or has
the potential to emit at least 50 tons per year of volatile organic
compounds shall be considered a major stationary source and sub-
ject to the requirements which would be applicable to major sta-
tionary sources if the area were classified as a Moderate nonattain-
ment area.
(c) ADDITIONAL CONTROL MEASURES.—
(1) R ECOMMENDATIONS.—Upon petition of any State within
a transport region established for ozone, and based on a major-
ity vote of the Governors on the Commission 92 (or their des-
ignees), the Commission 92 may, after notice and opportunity
for public comment, develop recommendations for additional
control measures to be applied within all or a part of such
transport region if the commission determines such measures
are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment
by the dates provided by this subpart. The commission shall
transmit such recommendations to the Administrator.
(2) NOTICE AND REVIEW.—Whenever the Administrator re-
ceives recommendations prepared by a commission pursuant to
paragraph (1) (the date of receipt of which shall hereinafter in
this section be referred to as the ‘‘receipt date’’), the Adminis-
trator shall—
(A) immediately publish in the Federal Register a no-
tice stating that the recommendations are available and
provide an opportunity for public hearing within 90 days
beginning on the receipt date; and
(B) commence a review of the recommendations to de-
termine whether the control measures in the recommenda-
tions are necessary to bring any area in such region into
attainment by the dates provided by this subpart and are
otherwise consistent with this Act.
(3) CONSULTATION.—In undertaking the review required
under paragraph (2)(B), the Administrator shall consult with
members of the commission of the affected States and shall
take into account the data, views, and comments received pur-
suant to paragraph (2)(A).
(4) APPROVAL AND DISAPPROVAL.—Within 9 months after
the receipt date, the Administrator shall (A) determine wheth-
er to approve, disapprove, or partially disapprove and partially
approve the recommendations; (B) notify the commission in
writing of such approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval;
and (C) publish such determination in the Federal Register. If

(5) FINDING.—Upon approval or partial approval of rec-
ommendations submitted by a commission, the Administrator
shall issue to each State which is included in the transport re-
gion and to which a requirement of the approved plan applies,
a finding under section 110(k)(5) that the implementation plan
for such State is inadequate to meet the requirements of sec-
tion 110(a)(2)(D). Such finding shall require each such State to
revise its implementation plan to include the approved addi-
tional control measures within one year after the finding is
issued.
(d) BEST AVAILABLE AIR QUALITY MONITORING AND MOD-
ELING.—For purposes of this section, not later than 6 months after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, the Administrator shall promulgate criteria for purposes of
determining the contribution of sources in one area to concentra-
tions of ozone in another area which is a nonattainment area for
ozone. Such criteria shall require that the best available air quality
monitoring and modeling techniques be used for purposes of mak-
ing such determinations.

SEC. 185. ENFORCEMENT FOR SEVERE AND EXTREME OZONE NON-
ATTAINMENT AREAS FOR FAILURE TO ATTAIN.
(a) GENERAL RULE.—Each implementation plan revision re-
quired under section 182 (d) and (e) (relating to the attainment
plan for Severe and Extreme ozone nonattainment areas) shall pro-
vide that, if the area to which such plan revision applies has failed
to attain the national primary ambient air quality standard for
ozone by the applicable attainment date, each major stationary
source of VOCs located in the area shall, except as otherwise pro-
vided under subsection (c), pay a fee to the State as a penalty for
such failure, computed in accordance with subsection (b), for each
calendar year beginning after the attainment date, until the area
is redesignated as an attainment area for ozone. Each such plan re-
vision should include procedures for assessment and collection of
such fees.
(b) COMPUTATION OF FEE.—
(1) FEE AMOUNT.—The fee shall equal $5,000, adjusted in
accordance with paragraph (3), per ton of VOC emitted by the
source during the calendar year in excess of 80 percent of the
baseline amount, computed under paragraph (2).
(2) BASELINE AMOUNT.—For purposes of this section, the
baseline amount shall be computed, in accordance with such
guidance as the Administrator may provide, as the lower of the

amount of actual VOC emissions (‘‘actuals’’) or VOC emissions
allowed under the permit applicable to the source (or, if no
such permit has been issued for the attainment year, the
amount of VOC emissions allowed under the applicable imple-
mentation plan (‘‘allowables’’)) during the attainment year.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Administrator
may issue guidance authorizing the baseline amount to be de-
termined in accordance with the lower of average actuals or
average allowables, determined over a period of more than one
calendar year. Such guidance may provide that such average
calculation for a specific source may be used if that source’s
emissions are irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly
from year to year.
(3) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.—The fee amount under para-
graph (1) shall be adjusted annually, beginning in the year be-
ginning after the year of enactment, in accordance with section
502(b)(3)(B)(v) (relating to inflation adjustment).
(c) EXCEPTION.—Notwithstanding any provision of this section,
no source shall be required to pay any fee under subsection (a) with
respect to emissions during any year that is treated as an Exten-
sion Year under section 181(a)(5).
(d) FEE COLLECTION BY THE ADMINISTRATOR.—If the Adminis-
trator has found that the fee provisions of the implementation plan
do not meet the requirements of this section, or if the Adminis-
trator makes a finding that the State is not administering and en-
forcing the fee required under this section, the Administrator shall,
in addition to any other action authorized under this title, collect,
in accordance with procedures promulgated by the Administrator,
the unpaid fees required under subsection (a). If the Administrator
makes such a finding under section 179(a)(4), the Administrator
may collect fees for periods before the determination, plus interest
computed in accordance with section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 (relating to computation of interest on under-
payment of Federal taxes), to the extent the Administrator finds
such fees have not been paid to the State. The provisions of clauses
(ii) through (iii) of section 502(b)(3)(C) (relating to penalties and
use of the funds, respectively) shall apply with respect to fees col-
lected under this subsection.
(e) EXEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN SMALL AREAS.—For areas with a
total population under 200,000 which fail to attain the standard by
the applicable attainment date, no sanction under this section or
under any other provision of this Act shall apply if the area can
demonstrate, consistent with guidance issued by the Administrator,
that attainment in the area is prevented because of ozone or ozone
precursors transported from other areas. The prohibition applies
only in cases in which the area has met all requirements and im-
plemented all measures applicable to the area under this Act.

cember 31, 1991. If the Administrator determines that the area at-
tained the standard, the Administrator shall require, as part of the
order, the State to submit a maintenance plan for the area within
12 months of such determination. If the Administrator determines
that the area failed to attain the standard, the Administrator shall,

which NOx reductions may contribute (or be counterproductive) to
achievement of attainment in different nonattainment areas, the
sensitivity of ozone to the control of NOx, the availability and ex-
tent of controls for NOx, the role of biogenic VOC emissions, and
the basic information required for air quality models. The study

Administrator shall publish a notice announcing the classification
of each such carbon monoxide nonattainment area. The provisions
of section 172(a)(1)(B) (relating to lack of notice-and-comment and
judicial review) shall apply with respect to such classification.
(3) If an area classified under paragraph (1), table 1, would
have been classified in another category if the design value in the
area were 5 percent greater or 5 percent less than the level on
which such classification was based, the Administrator may, in the
Administrator’s discretion, within 90 days after the date of the en-
actment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by the proce-
dure required under paragraph (2), adjust the classification of the
area. In making such adjustment, the Administrator may consider
the number of exceedances of the national primary ambient air
quality standard for carbon monoxide in the area, the level of pollu-
tion transport between the area and the other affected areas, and
the mix of sources and air pollutants in the area. The Adminis-
trator may make the same adjustment for purposes of paragraphs
(2), (3), (6), and (7) of section 187(a).
(4) Upon application by any State, the Administrator may ex-
tend for 1 additional year (hereinafter in this subpart referred to
as the ‘‘Extension Year’’) the date specified in table 1 of subsection
(a) if— (A) the State has complied with all requirements and com-
mitments pertaining to the area in the applicable implementa-
tion plan, and
(B) no more than one exceedance of the national ambient
air quality standard level for carbon monoxide has occurred in
the area in the year preceding the Extension Year.
No more than 2 one-year extensions may be issued under this
paragraph for a single nonattainment area.
(b) NEW DESIGNATIONS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS.—
(1) NEW DESIGNATIONS TO NONATTAINMENT.—Any area
that is designated attainment or unclassifiable for carbon mon-
oxide under section 107(d)(4), and that is subsequently redesig-
nated to nonattainment for carbon monoxide under section
107(d)(3), shall, at the time of the redesignation, be classified
by operation of law in accordance with table 1 under sub-

under this subsection, except to the extent the State has made such
submissions as of such date of enactment:
(1) I NVENTORY.—No later than 2 years from the date of the
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the State
shall submit a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of
actual emissions from all sources, as described in section
172(c)(3), in accordance with guidance provided by the Admin-
istrator.
(2)(A) VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED.—No later than 2 years
after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, for areas with a design value above 12.7 ppm
at the time of classification, the plan revision shall contain a
forecast of vehicle miles traveled in the nonattainment area
concerned for each year before the year in which the plan
projects the national ambient air quality standard for carbon
monoxide to be attained in the area. The forecast shall be
based on guidance which shall be published by the Adminis-
trator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation,
within 6 months after the date of the enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990. The plan revision shall provide

for annual updates of the forecasts to be submitted to the Ad-
ministrator together with annual reports regarding the extent
to which such forecasts proved to be accurate. Such annual re-
ports shall contain estimates of actual vehicle miles traveled in
each year for which a forecast was required.
(B) SPECIAL RULE FOR DENVER.—Within 2 years after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, in the case of Denver, the State shall submit a revision
that includes the transportation control measures as required
in section 182(d)(1)(A) except that such revision shall be for the
purpose of reducing CO emissions rather than volatile organic
compound emissions. If the State fails to include any such
measure, the implementation plan shall contain an explanation
of why such measure was not adopted and what emissions re-
duction measure was adopted to provide a comparable reduc-
tion in emissions, or reasons why such reduction is not nec-
essary to attain the national primary ambient air quality
standard for carbon monoxide.
(3) CONTINGENCY PROVISIONS.—No later than 2 years after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, for areas with a design value above 12.7 ppm at the
time of classification, the plan revision shall provide for the im-
plementation of specific measures to be undertaken if any esti-
mate of vehicle miles traveled in the area which is submitted
in an annual report under paragraph (2) exceeds the number
predicted in the most recent prior forecast or if the area fails
to attain the national primary ambient air quality standard for
carbon monoxide by the primary standard attainment date.
Such measures shall be included in the plan revision as contin-
gency measures to take effect without further action by the
State or the Administrator if the prior forecast has been ex-
ceeded by an updated forecast or if the national standard is not
attained by such deadline.
(4) SAVINGS CLAUSE FOR VEHICLE INSPECTION AND MAINTE-
NANCE PROVISIONS OF THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.—Im-
mediately after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, for any Moderate Area (or, within the
Administrator’s discretion, portion thereof), the plan for which
is of the type described in section 182(a)(2)(B) any provisions
necessary to ensure that the applicable implementation plan
includes the vehicle inspection and maintenance program de-
scribed in section 182(a)(2)(B).
(5) PERIODIC INVENTORY.—No later than September 30,
1995, and no later than the end of each 3 year period there-
after, until the area is redesignated to attainment, a revised
inventory meeting the requirements of subsection (a)(1).
(6) ENHANCED VEHICLE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE.—
No later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in the case of Moderate
Areas with a design value greater than 12.7 ppm at the time
of classification, a revision that includes provisions for an en-
hanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program as re-
quired in section 182(c)(3) (concerning serious ozone nonattain-

of reducing carbon monoxide rather than hydrocarbon emis-
sions.
(7) ATTAINMENT DEMONSTRATION AND SPECIFIC ANNUAL
EMISSION REDUCTIONS.—In the case of Moderate Areas with a
design value greater than 12.7 ppm at the time of classifica-
tion, no later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a revision to provide,
and a demonstration that the plan as revised will provide, for
attainment of the carbon monoxide NAAQS by the applicable
attainment date and provisions for such specific annual emis-
sion reductions as are necessary to attain the standard by that
date.
The Administrator may, in the Administrator’s discretion, require
States to submit a schedule for submitting any of the revisions or
other items required under this subsection. In the case of Moderate
Areas with a design value of 12.7 ppm or lower at the time of clas-
sification, the requirements of this subsection shall apply in lieu of
any requirement that the State submit a demonstration that the
applicable implementation plan provides for attainment of the car-
bon monoxide standard by the applicable attainment date.
(b) SERIOUS AREAS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Each State in which all or part of a Seri-
ous Area is located shall, with respect to the Serious Area,
make the submissions (other than those required under sub-
section (a)(1)(B) 94 ) applicable under subsection (a) to Moderate
Areas with a design value of 12.7 ppm or greater at the time
of classification, and shall also submit the revision and other
items described under this subsection.
(2) VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED.—Within 2 years after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 the State shall submit a revision that includes the trans-
portation control measures as required in section 182(d)(1) ex-
cept that such revision shall be for the purpose of reducing CO
emissions rather than volatile organic compound emissions. In
the case of any such area (other than an area in New York
State) which is a covered area (as defined in section
246(a)(2)(B)) for purposes of the Clean Fuel Fleet program
under part C of title II, if the State fails to include any such
measure, the implementation plan shall contain an explanation
of why such measure was not adopted and what emissions re-
duction measure was adopted to provide a comparable reduc-
tion in emissions, or reasons why such reduction is not nec-
essary to attain the national primary ambient air quality
standard for carbon monoxide.
(3) OXYGENATED GASOLINE.—(A) Within 2 years after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, the State shall submit a revision to require that gasoline
sold, supplied, offered for sale or supply, dispensed, trans-
ported or introduced into commerce in the larger of—

tan Statistical Area (as defined by the United States Office
of Management and Budget) in which the area is located,
be blended, during the portion of the year in which the area
is prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide (as
determined by the Administrator), with fuels containing such
level of oxygen as is necessary, in combination with other
measures, to provide for attainment of the carbon monoxide
national ambient air quality standard by the applicable attain-
ment date and maintenance of the national ambient air quality
standard thereafter in the area. The revision shall provide that
such requirement shall take effect no later than October 1,
1993, and shall include a program for implementation and en-
forcement of the requirement consistent with guidance to be
issued by the Administrator.
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the revision de-
scribed in this paragraph shall not be required for an area if
the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator
that the revision is not necessary to provide for attainment of
the carbon monoxide national ambient air quality standard by
the applicable attainment date and maintenance of the na-
tional ambient air quality standard thereafter in the area.
(c) AREAS WITH SIGNIFICANT STATIONARY SOURCE EMISSIONS
OF CO.—
(1) SERIOUS AREAS.—In the case of Serious Areas in which
stationary sources contribute significantly to carbon monoxide
levels (as determined under rules issued by the Administrator),
the State shall submit a plan revision within 2 years after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, which provides that the term ‘‘major stationary source’’
includes (in addition to the sources described in section 302)
any stationary source which emits, or has the potential to emit,
50 tons per year or more of carbon monoxide.
(2) WAIVERS FOR CERTAIN AREAS.—The Administrator may,
on a case-by-case basis, waive any requirements that pertain
to transportation controls, inspection and maintenance, or
oxygenated fuels where the Administrator determines by rule
that mobile sources of carbon monoxide do not contribute sig-
nificantly to carbon monoxide levels in the area.
(3) GUIDELINES.—Within 6 months after the date of the en-
actment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Admin-
istrator shall issue guidelines for and rules determining wheth-
er stationary sources contribute significantly to carbon mon-
oxide levels in an area.
(d) CO MILESTONE.—
(1) MILESTONE DEMONSTRATION.—By March 31, 1996, each
State in which all or part of a Serious Area is located shall
submit to the Administrator a demonstration that the area has
achieved a reduction in emissions of CO equivalent to the total
of the specific annual emission reductions required by Decem-
ber 31, 1995. Such reductions shall be referred to in this sub-
section as the milestone.
(2) ADEQUACY OF DEMONSTRATION.—A demonstration
under this paragraph shall be submitted in such form and

manner, and shall contain such information and analysis, as
the Administrator shall require. The Administrator shall deter-
mine whether or not a State’s demonstration is adequate with-
in 90 days after the Administrator’s receipt of a demonstration
which contains the information and analysis required by the
Administrator.
(3) FAILURE TO MEET EMISSION REDUCTION MILESTONE.—If
a State fails to submit a demonstration under paragraph (1)
within the required period, or if the Administrator notifies the
State that the State has not met the milestone, the State shall,
within 9 months after such a failure or notification, submit a
plan revision to implement an economic incentive and trans-
portation control program as described in section 182(g)(4).
Such revision shall be sufficient to achieve the specific annual
reductions in carbon monoxide emissions set forth in the plan
by the attainment date.
(e) MULTI-STATE CO NONATTAINMENT AREAS.—
(1) COORDINATION AMONG STATES.—Each State in which
there is located a portion of a single nonattainment area for
carbon monoxide which covers more than one State (‘‘multi-
State nonattainment area’’) shall take all reasonable steps to
coordinate, substantively and procedurally, the revisions and
implementation of State implementation plans applicable to
the nonattainment area concerned. The Administrator may not
approve any revision of a State implementation plan submitted
under this part for a State in which part of a multi-State non-
attainment area is located if the plan revision for that State
fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
(2) FAILURE TO DEMONSTRATE ATTAINMENT.—If any State
in which there is located a portion of a multi-State nonattain-
ment area fails to provide a demonstration of attainment of the
national ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide in
that portion within the period required under this part the
State may petition the Administrator to make a finding that
the State would have been able to make such demonstration
but for the failure of one or more other States in which other
portions of the area are located to commit to the implementa-
tion of all measures required under section 187 (relating to
plan submissions for carbon monoxide nonattainment areas). If
the Administrator makes such finding, in the portion of the
nonattainment area within the State submitting such petition,
no sanction shall be imposed under section 179 or under any
other provision of this Act, by reason of the failure to make
such demonstration.
(f) RECLASSIFIED AREAS.—Each State containing a carbon mon-
oxide nonattainment area reclassified under section 186(b)(2) shall
meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, as may be
applicable to the area as reclassified, according to the schedules
prescribed in connection with such requirements, except that the
Administrator may adjust any applicable deadlines (other than the
attainment date) where such deadlines are shown to be infeasible.
(g) FAILURE OF SERIOUS AREA TO ATTAIN STANDARD.—If the
Administrator determines under section 186(b)(2) that the national
primary ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide has not

the State shall submit a plan revision for the area within 9 months
after the date of such determination. The plan revision shall pro-
vide that a program of incentives and requirements as described in
section 182(g)(4) shall be applicable in the area, and such program,
in combination with other elements of the revised plan, shall be
adequate to reduce the total tonnage of emissions of carbon mon-
oxide in the area by at least 5 percent per year in each year after
approval of the plan revision and before attainment of the national
primary ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide.

(a) INITIAL CLASSIFICATIONS.—Every area designated non-
attainment for PM–10 pursuant to section 107(d) shall be classified
at the time of such designation, by operation of law, as a mod-
erate 95 PM–10 nonattainment area (also referred to in this subpart
as a ‘‘Moderate Area’’) at the time of such designation. At the time
of publication of the notice under section 107(d)(4) (relating to area
designations) for each PM–10 nonattainment area, the Adminis-
trator shall publish a notice announcing the classification of such
area. The provisions of section 172(a)(1)(B) (relating to lack of no-
tice-and-comment and judicial review) shall apply with respect to
such classification.
(b) RECLASSIFICATION AS SERIOUS.—
(1) RECLASSIFICATION BEFORE ATTAINMENT DATE.—The Ad-
ministrator may reclassify as a Serious PM–10 nonattainment
area (identified in this subpart also as a ‘‘Serious Area’’) any
area that the Administrator determines cannot practicably at-
tain the national ambient air quality standard for PM–10 by
the attainment date (as prescribed in subsection (c)) for Mod-
erate Areas. The Administrator shall reclassify appropriate
areas as Serious by the following dates:
(A) For areas designated nonattainment for PM–10
under section 107(d)(4), the Administrator shall propose to
reclassify appropriate areas by June 30, 1991, and take
final action by December 31, 1991.
(B) For areas subsequently designated nonattainment,
the Administrator shall reclassify appropriate areas within
18 months after the required date for the State’s submis-
sion of a SIP for the Moderate Area.
(2) RECLASSIFICATION UPON FAILURE TO ATTAIN.—Within 6
months following the applicable attainment date for a PM–10
nonattainment area, the Administrator shall determine wheth-
er the area attained the standard by that date. If the Adminis-

trator finds that any Moderate Area is not in attainment after
the applicable attainment date—
(A) the area shall be reclassified by operation of law
as a Serious Area; and
(B) the Administrator shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register no later than 6 months following the at-
tainment date, identifying the area as having failed to at-
tain and identifying the reclassification described under
subparagraph (A).
(c) ATTAINMENT DATES.—Except as provided under subsection
(d), the attainment dates for PM–10 nonattainment areas shall be
as follows:
(1) MODERATE AREAS.—For a Moderate Area, the attain-
ment date shall be as expeditiously as practicable but no later
than the end of the sixth calendar year after the area’s des-
ignation as nonattainment, except that, for areas designated
nonattainment for PM–10 under section 107(d)(4), the attain-
ment date shall not extend beyond December 31, 1994.
(2) SERIOUS AREAS.—For a Serious Area, the attainment
date shall be as expeditiously as practicable but no later than
the end of the tenth calendar year beginning after the area’s
designation as nonattainment, except that, for areas des-
ignated nonattainment for PM–10 under section 107(d)(4), the
date shall not extend beyond December 31, 2001.
(d) EXTENSION OF ATTAINMENT DATE FOR MODERATE AREAS.—
Upon application by any State, the Administrator may extend for
1additional year (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Extension Year’’)
the date specified in paragraph 96 (c)(1) if—
(1) the State has complied with all requirements and com-
mitments pertaining to the area in the applicable implementa-
tion plan; and
(2) no more than one exceedance of the 24-hour national
ambient air quality standard level for PM–10 has occurred in
the area in the year preceding the Extension Year, and the an-
nual mean concentration of PM–10 in the area for such year
is less than or equal to the standard level.
No more than 2 one-year extensions may be issued under the sub-
section for a single nonattainment area.
(e) EXTENSION OF ATTAINMENT DATE FOR SERIOUS AREAS.—
Upon application by any State, the Administrator may extend the
attainment date for a Serious Area beyond the date specified under
subsection (c), if attainment by the date established under sub-
section (c) would be impracticable, the State has complied with all
requirements and commitments pertaining to that area in the im-
plementation plan, and the State demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Administrator that the plan for that area includes the most
stringent measures that are included in the implementation plan
of any State or are achieved in practice in any State, and can fea-
sibly be implemented in the area. At the time of such application,
the State must submit a revision to the implementation plan that
includes a demonstration of attainment by the most expeditious al-
ternative date practicable. In determining whether to grant an ex-

tension, and the appropriate length of time for any such extension,
the Administrator may consider the nature and extent of non-
attainment, the types and numbers of sources or other emitting ac-
tivities in the area (including the influence of uncontrollable nat-
ural sources and transboundary emissions from foreign countries),
the population exposed to concentrations in excess of the standard,
the presence and concentration of potentially toxic substances in
the mix of particulate emissions in the area, and the technological
and economic feasibility of various control measures. The Adminis-
trator may not approve an extension until the State submits an at-
tainment demonstration for the area. The Administrator may grant
at most one such extension for an area, of no more than 5 years.
(f) WAIVERS FOR CERTAIN AREAS.—The Administrator may, on
a case-by-case basis, waive any requirement applicable to any Seri-
ous Area under this subpart where the Administrator determines
that anthropogenic sources of PM–10 do not contribute significantly
to the violation of the PM–10 standard in the area. The Adminis-
trator may also waive a specific date for attainment of the standard
where the Administrator determines that nonanthropogenic sources
of PM–10 contribute significantly to the violation of the PM–10
standard in the area.

Area is located shall submit an implementation plan for such
area that includes each of the following:
(A) A demonstration (including air quality modeling)—
(i) that the plan provides for attainment of the
PM–10 national ambient air quality standard by the
applicable attainment date, or
(ii) for any area for which the State is seeking,
pursuant to section 188(e), an extension of the attain-
ment date beyond the date set forth in section 188(c),
that attainment by that date would be impracticable,
and that the plan provides for attainment by the most
expeditious alternative date practicable.
(B) Provisions to assure that the best available control
measures for the control of PM–10 shall be implemented
no later than 4 years after the date the area is classified
(or reclassified) as a Serious Area.
(2) SCHEDULE FOR PLAN SUBMISSIONS.—A State shall sub-
mit the demonstration required for an area under paragraph
(1)(A) no later than 4 years after reclassification of the area to
Serious, except that for areas reclassified under section
188(b)(2), the State shall submit the attainment demonstration
within 18 months after reclassification to Serious. A State
shall submit the provisions described under paragraph (1)(B)
no later than 18 months after reclassification of the area as a
Serious Area.
(3) M AJOR SOURCES.—For any Serious Area, the terms
‘‘major source’’ and ‘‘major stationary source’’ include any sta-
tionary source or group of stationary sources located within a
contiguous area and under common control that emits, or has
the potential to emit, at least 70 tons per year of PM–10.
(c) MILESTONES.—(1) Plan revisions demonstrating attainment
submitted to the Administrator for approval under this subpart
shall contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved
every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which
demonstrate reasonable further progress, as defined in section
171(1), toward attainment by the applicable date.
(2) Not later than 90 days after the date on which a milestone
applicable to the area occurs, each State in which all or part of
such area is located shall submit to the Administrator a dem-
onstration that all measures in the plan approved under this sec-
tion have been implemented and that the milestone has been met.
A demonstration under this subsection shall be submitted in such
form and manner, and shall contain such information and analysis,

as the Administrator shall require. The Administrator shall deter-
mine whether or not a State’s demonstration under this subsection
is adequate within 90 days after the Administrator’s receipt of a
demonstration which contains the information and analysis re-
quired by the Administrator.
(3) If a State fails to submit a demonstration under paragraph
(2) with respect to a milestone within the required period or if the
Administrator determines that the area has not met any applicable
milestone, the Administrator shall require the State, within 9
months after such failure or determination to submit a plan revi-
sion that assures that the State will achieve the next milestone (or
attain the national ambient air quality standard for PM–10, if
there is no next milestone) by the applicable date.
(d) FAILURE TO ATTAIN.—In the case of a Serious PM–10 non-
attainment area in which the PM–10 standard is not attained by
the applicable attainment date, the State in which such area is lo-
cated shall, after notice and opportunity for public comment, sub-
mit within 12 months after the applicable attainment date, plan re-
visions which provide for attainment of the PM–10 air quality
standard and, from the date of such submission until attainment,
for an annual reduction in PM–10 or PM–10 precursor emissions
within the area of not less than 5 percent of the amount of such
emissions as reported in the most recent inventory prepared for
such area.
(e) PM–10 PRECURSORS.—The control requirements applicable
under plans in effect under this part for major stationary sources
of PM–10 shall also apply to major stationary sources of PM–10
precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such

PART A—MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSION AND FUEL STANDARDS
ESTABLISHMENT OF STANDARDS
S EC. 202. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)—
(1) The Administrator shall by regulation prescribe (and
from time to time revise) in accordance with the provisions of
this section, standards applicable to the emission of any air
pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or
new motor vehicle engines, which in his judgment cause, or
contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be antici-
pated to endanger public health or welfare. Such standards
shall be applicable to such vehicles and engines for their useful
life (as determined under subsection (d), relating to useful life
of vehicles for purposes of certification), whether such vehicles
and engines are designed as complete systems or incorporate
devices to prevent or control such pollution.
(2) Any regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) of this
subsection (and any revision thereof) shall take effect after
such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the
development and application of the requisite technology, giving
appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such
period.
(3)(A) IN GENERAL—(i) Unless the standard is changed as
provided in subparagraph (B), regulations under paragraph (1)
of this subsection applicable to emissions of hydrocarbons, car-
bon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter from
classes or categories of heavy-duty vehicles or engines manu-
factured during or after model year 1983 shall contain stand-
ards which reflect the greatest degree of emission reduction
achievable through the application of technology which the Ad-
ministrator determines will be available for the model year to

which such standards apply, giving appropriate consideration
to cost, energy, and safety factors associated with the applica-
tion of such technology.
(ii) In establishing classes or categories of vehicles or en-
gines for purposes of regulations under this paragraph, the Ad-
ministrator may base such classes or categories on gross vehi-
cle weight, horsepower, type of fuel used or other appropriate
factors.
(B) REVISED STANDARDS FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS.—(i) On
the basis of information available to the Administrator con-
cerning the effects of air pollutants emitted from heavy-duty
vehicles or engines and from other sources of mobile source re-
lated pollutants on the public health and welfare, and taking
costs into account, the Administrator may promulgate regula-
tions under paragraph (1) of this subsection revising any
standard promulgated under, or before the date of, the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (or previously
revised under this subparagraph) and applicable to classes or
categories of heavy-duty vehicles or engines.
(ii) Effective for the model year 1998 and thereafter, the
regulations under paragraph (1) of this subsection applicable to
emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from gasoline and diesel-
fueled heavy duty trucks shall contain standards which provide
that such emissions may not exceed 4.0 grams per brake horse-
power hour (gbh).
(C) LEAD TIME AND STABILITY.—Any standard promul-
gated or revised under this paragraph and applicable to classes
or categories of heavy-duty vehicles or engines shall apply for
a period of no less than 3 model years beginning no earlier
than the model year commencing 4 years after such revised
standard is promulgated.
(D) REBULDING PRACTICES.—The Administrator shall study
the practice of rebuilding heavy-duty engines and the impact
rebuilding has on engine emissions. On the basis of that study
and other information available to the Administrator, the Ad-
ministrator may prescribe requirements to control rebuilding
practices, including standards applicable to emissions from any
rebuilt heavy-duty engines (whether or not the engine is past
its statutory useful life), which in the Administrator’s judg-
ment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reason-
ably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare taking
costs into account. Any regulation shall take effect after a pe-
riod the Administrator finds necessary to permit the develop-
ment and application of the requisite control measures, giving
appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within the
period and energy and safety factors.
(E) MOTORCYCLES.—For purposes of this paragraph, mo-
torcycles and motorcycle engines shall be treated in the same
manner as heavy-duty vehicles and engines (except as other-
wise permitted under section 206(f)(1) 99 ) unless the the Ad-
ministrator promulgates a rule reclassifying motorcycles as

light-duty vehicles within the meaning of this section or unless
the Administrator promulgates regulations under subsection
(a) applying standards applicable to the emission of air pollut-
ants from motorcycles as a separate class or category. In any
case in which such standards are promulgated for such emis-
sions from motorcycles as a separate class or category, the Ad-
ministrator, in promulgating such standards, shall consider the
need to achieve equivalency of emission reductions between
motorcycles and other motor vehicles to the maximum extent
practicable.
(4)(A) Effective with respect to vehicles and engines manu-
factured after model year 1978, no emission control device, sys-
tem, or element of design shall be used in a new motor vehicle
or new motor vehicle engine for purposes of complying with re-
quirements prescribed under this title if such device, system,
or element of design will cause or contribute to an unreason-
able risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or
function.
(B) In determining whether an unreasonable risk exists
under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall consider,
among other factors, (i) whether and to what extent the use of
any device, system, or element of design causes, increases, re-
duces, or eliminates emissions of any unregulated pollutants;
(ii) available methods for reducing or eliminating any risk to
public health, welfare, or safety which may be associated with
the use of such device, system, or element of design, and (iii)
the availability of other devices, systems, or elements of design
which may be used to conform to requirements prescribed
under this title without causing or contributing to such unrea-
sonable risk. The Administrator shall include in the consider-
ation required by this paragraph all relevant information de-
veloped pursuant to section 214.
(5)(A) If the Administrator promulgates final regulations
which define the degree of control required and the test proce-
dures by which compliance could be determined for gasoline
vapor recovery of uncontrolled emissions from the fueling of
motor vehicles, the Administrator shall, after consultation with
the Secretary of Transportation with respect to motor vehicle
safety, prescribe, by regulation, fill pipe standards for new
motor vehicles in order to insure effective connection between
such fill pipe and any vapor recovery system which the Admin-
istrator determines may be required to comply with such vapor
recovery regulations. In promulgating such standards the Ad-
ministrator shall take into consideration limits on fill pipe di-
ameter, minimum design criteria for nozzle retainer lips, limits
on the location of the unleaded fuel restrictors, a minimum ac-
cess zone surrounding a fill pipe, a minimum pipe or nozzle in-
sertion angle, and such other factors as he deems pertinent.
(B) Regulations prescribing standards under subparagraph
(A) shall not become effective until the introduction of the
model year for which it would be feasible to implement such
standards, taking into consideration the restraints of an ade-
quate leadtime for design and production.

ministrator from specifying different nozzle and fill neck sizes
for gasoline with additives and gasoline without additives or
(ii) permit the Administrator to require a specific location, con-
figuration, modeling, or styling of the motor vehicle body with
respect to the fuel tank fill neck or fill nozzle clearance enve-
lope.(D) For the purpose of this paragraph, the term ‘‘fill pipe’’
shall include the fuel tank fill pipe, fill neck, fill inlet, and clo-
sure.
(6) ONBOARD VAPOR RECOVERY.—Within 1 year after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, the Administrator shall, after consultation with the Sec-
retary of Transportation regarding the safety of vehicle-based
(‘‘onboard’’) systems for the control of vehicle refueling emis-
sions, promulgate standards under this section requiring that
new light-duty vehicles manufactured beginning in the fourth
model year after the model year in which the standards are
promulgated and thereafter shall be equipped with such sys-
tems. The standards required under this paragraph shall apply
to a percentage of each manufacturer’s fleet of new light-duty
vehicles beginning with the fourth model year after the model
year in which the standards are promulgated. The percentage
shall be as specified in the following table:
I MPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE FOR ONBOARD VAPOR RECOVERY
REQUIREMENTS
Model year commencing after standards promulgated Percentage *
Fourth .................................................................................. 40
Fifth ...................................................................................... 80
After Fifth ............................................................................ 100
*Percentages in the table refer to a percentage of the manufacturer’s sales vol-
ume.
The standards shall require that such systems provide a min-
imum evaporative emission capture efficiency of 95 percent.
The requirements of section 182(b)(3) (relating to stage II gaso-
line vapor recovery) for areas classified under section 181 as
moderate for ozone shall not apply after promulgation of such
standards and the Administrator may, by rule, revise or waive
the application of the requirements of such section 182(b)(3) for
areas classified under section 181 as Serious, Severe, or Ex-
treme for ozone, as appropriate, after such time as the Admin-
istrator determines that onboard emissions control systems re-
quired under this paragraph are in widespread use throughout
the motor vehicle fleet.
(b)(1)(A) The regulations under subsection (a) applicable to
emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from light-duty ve-
hicles and engines manufactured during model years 1977 through
1979 shall contain standards which provide that such emissions
from such vehicles and engines may not exceed 1.5 grams per vehi-
cle mile of hydrocarbons and 15.0 grams per vehicle mile of carbon
monoxide. The regulations under subsection (a) applicable to emis-
sions of carbon monoxide from light-duty vehicles and engines

manufactured during the model year 1980 shall contain standards
which provide that such emissions may not exceed 7.0 grams per
vehicle mile. The regulations under subsection (a) applicable to
emissions of hydrocarbons from light-duty vehicles and engines
manufactured during or after model year 1980 shall contain stand-
ards which require a reduction of at least 90 percent from emis-
sions of such pollutant allowable under the standards under this
section applicable to light-duty vehicles and engines manufactured
in model year 1970. Unless waived as provided in paragraph (5),
regulations under subsection (a) applicable to emissions of carbon
monoxide from light-duty vehicles and engines manufactured dur-
ing or after the model year 1981 shall contain standards which re-
quire a reduction of at least 90 percent from emissions of such pol-
lutant allowable under the standards under this section applicable
to light-duty vehicles and engines manufactured in model year
1970.
(B) The regulations under subsection (a) applicable to emis-
sions of oxides of nitrogen from light-duty vehicles and engines
manufactured during model years 1977 through 1980 shall contain
standards which provide that such emissions from such vehicles
and engines may not exceed 2.0 grams per vehicle mile. The regu-
lations under subsection (a) applicable to emissions of oxides of ni-
trogen from light-duty vehicles and engines manufactured during
the model year 1981 and thereafter shall contain standards which
provide that such emissions from such vehicles and engines may
not exceed 1.0 gram per vehicle mile. The Administrator shall pre-
scribe standards in lieu of those required by the preceding sentence
which provide that emissions of oxides of nitrogen may not exceed
2.0 grams per vehicle mile for any light-duty vehicle manufactured
during model years 1981 and 1982 by any manufacturer whose pro-
duction, by corporate identity, for calendar year 1976 was less than
three hundred thousand light-duty motor vehicles worldwide if the
Administrator determines that—
(i) the ability of such manufacturer to meet emission
standards in the 1975 and subsequent model years was, and
is, primarily dependent upon technology developed by other
manufacturers and purchased from such manufacturers; and
(ii) such manufacturer lacks the financial resources and
technological ability to develop such technology.
(C) The Administrator may promulgate regulations under sub-
section (a)(1) revising any standard prescribed or previously revised
under this subsection, as needed to protect public health or welfare,
taking costs, energy, and safety into account. Any revised standard
shall require a reduction of emissions from the standard that was
previously applicable. Any such revision under this title may pro-
vide for a phase-in of the standard. It is the intent of Congress that
the numerical emission standards specified in subsections
(a)(3)(B)(ii), (g), (h), and (i) shall not be modified by the Adminis-
trator after the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 for any model year before the model year 2004.

(A)(i) The term ‘‘model year’’ with reference to any specific
calendar year means the manufacturer’s annual production pe-
riod (as determined by the Administrator) which includes Jan-
uary 1 of such calendar year. If the manufacturer has no an-
nual production period, the term ‘‘model year’’ shall mean the
calendar year.
(ii) For the purpose of assuring that vehicles and engines
manufactured before the beginning of a model year were not
manufactured for purposes of circumventing the effective date
of a standard required to be prescribed by subsection (b), the
Administrator may prescribe regulations defining ‘‘model year’’
otherwise than as provided in clause (i).

(C) The term ‘‘heavy duty vehicle’’ means a truck, bus, or
other vehicle manufactured primarily for use on the public
streets, roads, and highways (not including any vehicle oper-
ated exclusively on a rail or rails) which has a gross vehicle
weight (as determined under regulations promulgated by the
Administrator) in excess of six thousand pounds. Such term in-
cludes any such vehicle which has special features enabling off-
street or off-highway operation and use.
(3) Upon the petition of any manufacturer, the Administrator,
after notice and opportunity for public hearing, may waive the
standard required under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) to not
exceed 1.5 grams of oxides of nitrogen per vehicle mile for any class
or category of light-duty vehicles or engines manufactured by such
manufacturer during any period of up to four model years begin-
ning after the model year 1980 if the manufacturer demonstrates
that such waiver is necessary to permit the use of an innovative
power train technology, or innovative emission control device or
system, in such class or category of vehicles or engines and that
such technology or system was not utilized by more than 1 percent
of the light-duty vehicles sold in the United States in the 1975
model year. Such waiver may be granted only if the Administrator
determines—
(A) that such waiver would not endanger public health,
(B) that there is a substantial likelihood that the vehicles
or engines will be able to comply with the applicable standard
under this section at the expiration of the waiver, and
(C) that the technology or system has a potential for long-
term air quality benefit and has the potential to meet or ex-
ceed the average fuel economy standard applicable under the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act upon the expiration of the
waiver.

priate arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to con-
duct a comprehensive study and investigation of the technological
feasibility of meeting the emissions standards required to be pre-
scribed by the Administrator by subsection (b) of this section.
(2) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated to the Adminis-
trator by this Act, such amounts as are required shall be available
to carry out the study and investigation authorized by paragraph
(1) of this subsection.
(3) In entering into any arrangement with the National Acad-
emy of Sciences for conducting the study and investigation author-
ized by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator shall re-
quest the National Academy of Sciences to submit semiannual re-
ports on the progress of its study and investigation to the Adminis-
trator and the Congress, beginning not later than July 1, 1971, and
continuing until such study and investigation is completed.
(4) The Administrator shall furnish to such Academy at its re-
quest any information which the Academy deems necessary for the
purpose of conducting the investigation and study authorized by
paragraph (1) of this subsection. For the purpose of furnishing such
information, the Administrator may use any authority he has
under this Act (A) to obtain information from any person, and (B)
to require such person to conduct such tests, keep such records,
and make such reports respecting research or other activities con-
ducted by such person as may be reasonably necessary to carry out
this subsection.
(d) The Administrator shall prescribe regulations under which
the useful life of vehicles and engines shall be determined for pur-
poses of subsection (a)(1) of this section and section 207. Such regu-
lations shall provide that except where a different useful life period
is specified in this title useful life shall—

engines and light-duty trucks up to 3,750 lbs. LVW and up to
6,000 lbs. GVWR, be a period of use of five years or of fifty
thousand miles (or the equivalent), whichever first occurs, ex-
cept that in the case of any requirement of this section which
first becomes applicable after the enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 where the useful life period is not
otherwise specified for such vehicles and engines, the period

cles or engines shall not require a percentage of reduction in the
emissions of such vehicles which is greater than the required per-
centage of reduction in emissions from motor vehicles as set forth
in section 202(b). This percentage reduction shall be determined by
comparing any proposed high altitude emission standards to high
altitude emissions from vehicles manufactured during model year
1970. In no event shall regulations applicable to high altitude vehi-

ical standard which is more stringent than that applicable to vehi-
cles certified under non-high altitude conditions.
(3) Section 307(d) shall apply to any high altitude regulation
referred to in paragraph (2) and before promulgating any such reg-
ulation, the Administrator shall consider and make a finding with
respect to—
(A) the economic impact upon consumers, individual high
altitude dealers, and the automobile industry of any such regu-
lation, including the economic impact which was experienced
as a result of the regulation imposed during model year 1977
with respect to high altitude certification requirements;
(B) the present and future availability of emission control
technology capable of meeting the applicable vehicle and en-
gine emission requirements without reducing model avail-
ability; and
(C) the likelihood that the adoption of such a high altitude
regulation will result in any significant improvement in air
quality in any area to which it shall apply.

Such study shall also consider other standards and useful life peri-
ods which are more stringent or less stringent than those set forth
in table 3 (but more stringent than those referred to in subsections
(g) and (h)).
(2)(A) As part of the study under paragraph (1), the Adminis-
trator shall examine the need for further reductions in emissions
in order to attain or maintain the national ambient air quality
standards, taking into consideration the waiver provisions of sec-
tion 209(b). As part of such study, the Administrator shall also ex-
amine— (i) the availability of technology (including the costs there-
of), in the case of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks with
a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) of 3,750 lbs. or less, for meeting
more stringent emission standards than those provided in sub-
sections (g) and (h) for model years commencing not earlier
than after January 1, 2003, and not later than model year
2006, including the lead time and safety and energy impacts
of meeting more stringent emission standards; and
(ii) the need for, and cost effectiveness of, obtaining further
reductions in emissions from such light-duty vehicles and light-
duty trucks, taking into consideration alternative means of at-
taining or maintaining the national primary ambient air qual-
ity standards pursuant to State implementation plans and

later than June 1, 1997, containing the results of the study under
this subsection, including the results of the examination conducted
under subparagraph (A). Before submittal of such report the Ad-
ministrator shall provide a reasonable opportunity for public com-
ment and shall include a summary of such comments in the report
to Congress.
(3)(A) Based on the study under paragraph (1) the Adminis-
trator shall determine, by rule, within 3 calendar years after the
report is submitted to Congress, but not later than December 31,
1999, whether—
(i) there is a need for further reductions in emissions as
provided in paragraph (2)(A);
(ii) the technology for meeting more stringent emission
standards will be available, as provided in paragraph (2)(A)(i),
in the case of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks with a
loaded vehicle weight (LVW) of 3,750 lbs. or less, for model
years commencing not earlier than January 1, 2003 and not
later than model year 2006, considering the factors listed in
paragraph (2)(A)(i); and
(iii) obtaining further reductions in emissions from such
vehicles will be needed and cost effective, taking into consider-
ation alternatives as provided in paragraph (2)(A)(ii).
The rulemaking under this paragraph shall commence within 3
months after submission of the report to Congress under paragraph
(2)(B).
(B) If the Administrator determines under subparagraph (A)
that—
(i) there is no need for further reductions in emissions as
provided in paragraph (2)(A);
(ii) the technology for meeting more stringent emission
standards will not be available as provided in paragraph
(2)(A)(i), in the case of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks
with a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) of 3,750 lbs. or less, for
model years commencing not earlier than January 1, 2003, and
not later than model year 2006, considering the factors listed
in paragraph (2)(A)(i); or
(iii) obtaining further reductions in emissions from such
vehicles will not be needed or cost effective, taking into consid-
eration alternatives as provided in paragraph (2)(A)(ii),
the Administrator shall not promulgate more stringent standards
than those in effect pursuant to subsections (g) and (h). Nothing in
this paragraph shall prohibit the Administrator from exercising the
Administrator’s authority under subsection (a) to promulgate more
stringent standards for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks
with a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) of 3,750 lbs. or less at any
other time thereafter in accordance with subsection (a).

paragraph (2)(A)(i); and
(iii) obtaining further reductions in emissions from such
vehicles will be needed and cost effective, taking into consider-
ation alternatives as provided in paragraph (2)(A)(ii),
the Administrator shall either promulgate the standards (and use-
ful life periods) set forth in Table 3 in paragraph (1) or promulgate
alternative standards (and useful life periods) which are more
stringent than those referred to in subsections (g) and (h). Any
such standards (or useful life periods) promulgated by the Adminis-
trator shall take effect with respect to any such vehicles or engines
no earlier than the model year 2003 but not later than model year
2006, as determined by the Administrator in the rule.
(D) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed by the Ad-
ministrator or by a court as a presumption that any standards (or
useful life period) set forth in Table 3 shall be promulgated in the
rulemaking required under this paragraph. The action required of
the Administrator in accordance with this paragraph shall be treat-
ed as a nondiscretionary duty for purposes of section 304(a)(2) (re-
lating to citizen suits).
(E) Unless the Administrator determines not to promulgate
more stringent standards as provided in subparagraph (B) or to
postpone the effective date of standards referred to in Table 3 in
paragraph (1) or to establish alternative standards as provided in
subparagraph (C), effective with respect to model years com-
mencing after January 1, 2003, the regulations under subsection
(a) applicable to emissions of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC),

(2) PHASE II.—(A) Not later than June 1, 1997, the Admin-
istrator shall complete a study assessing the need for further
reductions in emissions of carbon monoxide and the maximum
reductions in such emissions achievable from model year 2001
and later model year light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks
when operated at 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
(B)(i) If as of June 1, 1997, 6 or more nonattainment areas
have a carbon monoxide design value of 9.5 ppm or greater, the
regulations under subsection (a)(1) of this section applicable to
emissions of carbon monoxide from model year 2002 and later
model year light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks shall con-
tain standards which provide that emissions of carbon mon-
oxide from such vehicles and trucks when operated at 20 de-
grees Fahrenheit may not exceed 3.4 grams per mile (gpm) in
the case of light-duty vehicles and 4.4 grams per mile (gpm) in
the case of light-duty trucks up to 6,000 GVWR and a level
comparable in stringency in the case of light-duty trucks 6,000
GVWR and above.
(ii) In determining for purposes of this subparagraph
whether 6 or more nonattainment areas have a carbon mon-
oxide design value of 9.5 ppm or greater, the Administrator
shall exclude the areas of Steubenville, Ohio, and Oshkosh,
Wisconsin.
(3) USEFUL-LIFE FOR PHASE I AND PHASE II STANDARDS.—
In the case of the standards referred to in paragraphs (1) and
(2), for purposes of certification under section 206 and in-use
compliance under section 207, the applicable useful life period

that the Administrator may extend such useful life period (for
purposes of section 206, or section 207, or both) if he deter-
mines that it is feasible for vehicles and engines subject to
such standards to meet such standards for a longer useful life.
If the Administrator extends such useful life period, the Ad-
ministrator may make an appropriate adjustment of applicable
standards for such extended useful life. No such extended use-
ful life shall extend beyond the useful life period provided in
regulations under subsection (d).
(4) H EAVY-DUTY VEHICLES AND ENGINES.—The Adminis-
trator may also promulgate regulations under subsection (a)(1)
applicable to emissions of carbon monoxide from heavy-duty

(1) during operation; and
(2) over 2 or more days of nonuse;
under ozone-prone summertime conditions (as determined by regu-
lations of the Administrator). The regulations shall take effect as
expeditiously as possible and shall require the greatest degree of
emission reduction achievable by means reasonably expected to be
available for production during any model year to which the regula-
tions apply, giving appropriate consideration to fuel volatility, and
to cost, energy, and safety factors associated with the application
of the appropriate technology. The Administrator shall commence
a rulemaking under this subsection within 12 months after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
If final regulations are not promulgated under this subsection with-
in 18 months after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall submit a statement
to the Congress containing an explanation of the reasons for the
delay and a date certain for promulgation of such final regulations
in accordance with this Act. Such date certain shall not be later
than 15 months after the expiration of such 18 month deadline.
(l) MOBILE SOURCE-RELATED AIR TOXICS.—
(1) STUDY.—Not later than 18 months after the date of the
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Ad-
ministrator shall complete a study of the need for, and feasi-
bility of, controlling emissions of toxic air pollutants which are
unregulated under this Act and associated with motor vehicles
and motor vehicle fuels, and the need for, and feasibility of,
controlling such emissions and the means and measures for
such controls. The study shall focus on those categories of
emissions that pose the greatest risk to human health or about
which significant uncertainties remain, including emissions of
benzene, formaldehyde, and 1, 3 107 butadiene. The proposed
report shall be available for public review and comment and
shall include a summary of all comments.
(2) STANDARDS.—Within 54 months after the date of the
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Ad-
ministrator shall, based on the study under paragraph (1), pro-
mulgate (and from time to time revise) regulations under sub-
section (a)(1) or section 211(c)(1) containing reasonable require-
ments to control hazardous air pollutants from motor vehicles
and motor vehicle fuels. The regulations shall contain stand-
ards for such fuels or vehicles, or both, which the Adminis-
trator determines reflect the greatest degree of emission reduc-
tion achievable through the application of technology which
will be available, taking into consideration the standards es-
tablished under subsection (a), the availability and costs of the
technology, and noise, energy, and safety factors, and lead
time. Such regulations shall not be inconsistent with standards
under section 202(a). The regulations shall, at a minimum,
apply to emissions of benzene and formaldehyde.

shall promulgate regulations under subsection (a) requiring
manufacturers to install on all new light duty vehicles and
light duty trucks diagnostics systems capable of—
(A) accurately identifying for the vehicle’s useful life
as established under this section, emission-related systems
deterioration or malfunction, including, at a minimum, the
catalytic converter and oxygen sensor, which could cause
or result in failure of the vehicles to comply with emission
standards established under this section,
(B) alerting the vehicle’s owner or operator to the like-
ly need for emission-related components or systems main-
tenance or repair,
(C) storing and retrieving fault codes specified by the
Administrator, and
(D) providing access to stored information in a manner
specified by the Administrator.
The Administrator may, in the Administrator’s discretion, pro-
mulgate regulations requiring manufacturers to install such
onboard diagnostic systems on heavy-duty vehicles and en-
gines.
(2) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The regulations required under
paragraph (1) of this subsection shall take effect in model year
1994, except that the Administrator may waive the application
of such regulations for model year 1994 or 1995 (or both) with
respect to any class or category of motor vehicles if the Admin-
istrator determines that it would be infeasible to apply the reg-
ulations to that class or category in such model year or years,
consistent with corresponding regulations or policies adopted
by the California Air Resources Board for such systems.
(3) S TATE INSPECTION.—The Administrator shall by regula-
tion require States that have implementation plans containing
motor vehicle inspection and maintenance programs to amend
their plans within 2 years after promulgation of such regula-
tions to provide for inspection of onboard diagnostics systems
(as prescribed by regulations under paragraph (1) of this sub-
section) and for the maintenance or repair of malfunctions or
system deterioration identified by or affecting such diagnostics
systems. Such regulations shall not be inconsistent with the
provisions for warranties promulgated under section 207(a)
and (b).
(4) S PECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.—In promulgating regulations
under this subsection, the Administrator shall require—
(A) that any connectors through which the emission
control diagnostics system is accessed for inspection, diag-
nosis, service, or repair shall be standard and uniform on
all motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines;
(B) that access to the emission control diagnostics sys-
tem through such connectors shall be unrestricted and
shall not require any access code or any device which is
only available from a vehicle manufacturer; and
(C) that the output of the data from the emission con-
trol diagnostics system through such connectors shall be
usable without the need for any unique decoding informa-
tion or device.

promptly to any person engaged in the repairing or servicing
of motor vehicles or motor vehicle engines, and the Adminis-
trator for use by any such persons, with any and all informa-
tion needed to make use of the emission control diagnostics
system prescribed under this subsection and such other infor-
mation including instructions for making emission related di-
agnosis and repairs. No such information may be withheld
under section 208(c) if that information is provided (directly or
indirectly) by the manufacturer to franchised dealers or other
persons engaged in the repair, diagnosing, or servicing of
motor vehicles or motor vehicle engines. Such information shall
also be available to the Administrator, subject to section 208(c),
in carrying out the Administrator’s responsibilities under this
section.

No action with respect to any element of design referred to in para-
graph (3) (including any adjustment or alteration of such element)
shall be treated as a prohibited act under such paragraph (3) if
such action is in accordance with section 215. Nothing in para-
graph (3) shall be construed to require the use of manufacturer
parts in maintaining or repairing any motor vehicle or motor vehi-
cle engine. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the term
‘‘manufacturer parts’’ means, with respect to a motor vehicle en-
gine, parts produced or sold by the manufacturer of the motor vehi-
cle or motor vehicle engine. No action with respect to any device
or element of design referred to in paragraph (3) shall be treated
as a prohibited act under that paragraph if (i) the action is for the
purpose of repair or replacement of the device or element, or is a
necessary and temporary procedure to repair or replace any other

tioning of the device or element referred to in paragraph (3). No ac-
tion with respect to any device or element of design referred to in
paragraph (3) shall be treated as a prohibited act under that para-
graph if the action is for the purpose of a conversion of a motor ve-
hicle for use of a clean alternative fuel (as defined in this title) and
if such vehicle complies with the applicable standard under section
202 when operating on such fuel, and if in the case of a clean alter-
native fuel vehicle (as defined by rule by the Administrator), the
device or element is replaced upon completion of the conversion
procedure and such action results in proper functioning of the de-
vice or element when the motor vehicle operates on conventional
fuel.
(b)(1) The Administrator may exempt any new motor vehicle or
new motor vehicle engine from subsection (a), upon such terms and
conditions as he may find necessary for the purpose of research, in-
vestigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, or for reasons of
national security.
(2) A new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine offered for
importation or imported by any person in violation of subsection (a)
shall be refused admission into the United States, but the Sec-
retary of the Treasury and the Administrator may, by joint regula-
tion, provide for deferring final determination as to admission and
authorizing the delivery of such a motor vehicle or engine offered
for import to the owner or consignee thereof upon such terms and
conditions (including the furnishing of a bond) as may appear to
them appropriate to insure that any such motor vehicle or engine
will be brought into conformity with the standards, requirements,
and limitations applicable to it under this part. The Secretary of
the Treasury shall, if a motor vehicle or engine is finally refused
admission under this paragraph, cause disposition thereof in ac-
cordance with the customs laws unless it is exported, under regula-
tions prescribed by such Secretary, within ninety days of the date
of notice of such refusal or such additional time as may be per-
mitted pursuant to such regulations, except that disposition in ac-
cordance with the customs laws may not be made in such manner
as may result, directly or indirectly, in the sale, to the ultimate
consumer, of a new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine that
fails to comply with applicable standards of the Administrator
under this part.
(3) A new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine intended
solely for export, and so labeled or tagged on the outside of the con-
tainer and on the vehicle or engine itself, shall be subject to the
provisions of subsection (a), except that if the country which is to
receive such vehicle or engine has emission standards which differ
from the standards prescribed under section 202, then such vehicle
or engine shall comply with the standards of such country which
is to receive such vehicle or engine.

SEC. 205. CIVIL PENALTIES.
(a) VIOLATIONS.—Any person who violates sections 109
203(a)(1), 203(a)(4), or 203(a)(5) or any manufacturer or dealer who
violates section 203(a)(3)(A) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not
more than $25,000. Any person other than a manufacturer or deal-
er who violates section 203(a)(3)(A) or any person who violates sec-
tion 203(a)(3)(B) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than
$2,500. Any such violation with respect to paragraph (1), (3)(A), or
(4) of section 203(a) shall constitute a separate offense with respect
to each motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine. Any such violation
with respect to section 203(a)(3)(B) shall constitute a separate of-
fense with respect to each part or component. Any person who vio-
lates section 203(a)(2) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more
than $25,000 per day of violation.
(b) CIVIL ACTIONS.—The Administrator may commence a civil
action to assess and recover any civil penalty under subsection (a)
of this section, section 211(d), or section 213(d). Any action under
this subsection may be brought in the district court of the United
States for the district in which the violation is alleged to have oc-
curred or in which the defendant resides or has the Administrator’s
principal place of business, and the court shall have jurisdiction to
assess a civil penalty. In determining the amount of any civil pen-
alty to be assessed under this subsection, the court shall take into
account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings
(if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator’s busi-
ness, the violator’s history of compliance with this title, action
taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the viola-
tor’s ability to continue in business, and such other matters as jus-
tice may require. In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who
are required to attend a district court in any district may run into
any other district.
(c) ADMINISTRATIVE ASSESSMENT OF CERTAIN PENALTIES.—
(1) ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY AUTHORITY.—In lieu of com-
mencing a civil action under subsection (b), the Administrator
may assess any civil penalty prescribed in subsection (a) of this
section, section 211(d), or section 213(d), except that the max-
imum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a pen-
alty assessment proceeding shall not exceed $200,000, unless
the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine
that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate
for administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination
by the Administrator and the Attorney General shall not be
subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty under
this subsection shall be by an order made on the record after
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with sections 554 and
556 of title 5 of the United States Code. The Administrator

shall issue reasonable rules for discovery and other procedures
for hearings under this paragraph. Before issuing such an
order, the Administrator shall give written notice to the person
to be assessed an administrative penalty of the Administrator’s
proposal to issue such order and provide such person an oppor-
tunity to request such a hearing on the order, within 30 days
of the date the notice is received by such person. The Adminis-
trator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions,
any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this
section.
(2) DETERMINING AMOUNT.—In determining the amount of
any civil penalty assessed under this subsection, the Adminis-
trator shall take into account the gravity of the violation, the
economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the viola-
tion, the size of the violator’s business, the violator’s history of
compliance with this title, action taken to remedy the violation,
the effect of the penalty on the violator’s ability to continue in
business, and such other matters as justice may require.
(3) EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATOR’S ACTION.—(A) Action by the
Administrator under this subsection shall not affect or limit
the Administrator’s authority to enforce any provision of this
Act; except that any violation,
(i) with respect to which the Administrator has com-
menced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this
subsection, or
(ii) for which the Administrator has issued a final
order not subject to further judicial review and the violator
has paid a penalty assessment under this subsection,
shall not be the subject of civil penalty action under subsection
(b). (B) No action by the Administrator under this subsection
shall affect any person’s obligation to comply with any section
of this Act.
(4) FINALITY OF ORDER.—An order issued under this sub-
section shall become final 30 days after its issuance unless a
petition for judicial review is filed under paragraph (5).
(5) J UDICIAL REVIEW.—Any person against whom a civil
penalty is assessed in accordance with this subsection may
seek review of the assessment in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia, or for the district in which
the violation is alleged to have occurred, in which such person
resides, or where such person’s principal place of business is lo-
cated, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil
penalty order is issued. Such person shall simultaneously send
a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and
the Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the court
a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record
on which the order was issued within 30 days. The court shall
not set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with
the requirements of this subsection unless there is not sub-
stantial evidence in the record, taken as a whole, to support
the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator’s assess-
ment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the
court shall not impose additional civil penalties unless the Ad-

ministrator’s assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of
discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to
recover civil penalties assessed under this section.
(6) COLLECTION.—If any person fails to pay an assessment
of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in
this subsection—
(A) after the order making the assessment has become
final, or
(B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph
(5) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Adminis-
trator,
the Administrator shall request the Attorney General to bring
a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the
amount assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to
section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from
the date of the final order or the date of the final judgment,
as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount,
and appropriateness of the penalty shall not be subject to re-
view. Any person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount
of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in the first sen-
tence of this paragraph shall be required to pay, in addition to
that amount and interest, the United States’ enforcement ex-
penses, including attorneys fees and costs for collection pro-
ceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter
during which such failure to pay persists. The nonpayment
penalty shall be in an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggre-
gate amount of that person’s penalties and nonpayment pen-
alties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.

MOTOR VEHICLE AND MOTOR VEHICLE ENGINE COMPLIANCE TESTING
AND CERTIFICATION
S EC. 206. (a)(1) The Administrator shall test, or require to be
tested in such manner as he deems appropriate, any new motor ve-
hicle or new motor vehicle engine submitted by a manufacturer to
determine whether such vehicle or engine conforms with the regu-
lations prescribed under section 202 of this Act. If such vehicle or
engine conforms to such regulations, the Administrator shall issue
a certificate of conformity upon such terms, and for such period
(not in excess of one year) as he may prescribe. In the case of any
original equipment manufacturer (as defined by the Administrator
in regulations promulgated before the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) of vehicles or vehicle engines
whose projected sales in the United States for any model year (as
determined by the Administrator) will not exceed 300, the Adminis-
trator shall not require, for purposes of determining compliance
with regulations under section 202 for the useful life of the vehicle
or engine, operation of any vehicle or engine manufactured during
such model year for more than 5,000 miles or 160 hours, respec-
tively, unless the Administrator, by regulation, prescribes other-
wise. The Administrator shall apply any adjustment factors that
the Administrator deems appropriate to assure that each vehicle or

engine will comply during its useful life (as determined under sec-
tion 202(d)) with the regulations prescribed under section 202.
(2) The Administrator shall test any emission control system
incorporated in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine submitted
to him by any person, in order to determine whether such system
enables such vehicle or engine to conform to the standards required
to be prescribed under section 202(b) of this Act. If the Adminis-
trator finds on the basis of such tests that such vehicle or engine
conforms to such standards, the Administrator shall issue a
verification of compliance with emission standards for such system
when incorporated in vehicles of a class of which the tested vehicle
is representative. He shall inform manufacturers and the National
Academy of Sciences, and make available to the public, the results
of such tests. Tests under this paragraph shall be conducted under
such terms and conditions (including requirements for preliminary
testing by qualified independent laboratories) as the Administrator
may prescribe by regulations.
(3)(A) A certificate of conformity may be issued under this sec-
tion only if the Administrator determines that the manufacturer (or
in the case of a vehicle or engine for import, any person) has estab-
lished to the satisfaction of the Administrator that any emission
control device, system, or element of design installed on, or incor-
porated in, such vehicle or engine conforms to applicable require-
ments of section 202(a)(4).
(B) The Administrator may conduct such tests and may require
the manufacturer (or any such person) to conduct such tests and
provide such information as is necessary to carry out subparagraph
(A) of this paragraph. Such requirements shall include a require-
ment for prompt reporting of the emission of any unregulated pol-
lutant from a system, device, or element of design if such pollutant
was not emitted, or was emitted in significantly lesser amounts,
from the vehicle or engine without use of the system, device, or ele-
ment of design.
(4)(A) Not later than 12 months after the date of the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator
shall revise the regulations promulgated under this subsection to
add test procedures capable of determining whether model year
1994 and later model year light-duty vehicles and light-duty
trucks, when properly maintained and used, will pass the inspec-
tion methods and procedures established under section 207(b) for
that model year, under conditions reasonably likely to be encoun-
tered in the conduct of inspection and maintenance programs, but
which those programs cannot reasonably influence or control. The
conditions shall include fuel characteristics, ambient temperature,
and short (30 minutes or less) waiting periods before tests are con-
ducted. The Administrator shall not grant a certificate of con-
formity under this subsection for any 1994 or later model year ve-
hicle or engine that the Administrator concludes cannot pass the
test procedures established under this paragraph.
(B) From time to time, the Administrator may revise the regu-
lations promulgated under subparagraph (A), as the Administrator
deems appropriate.

production, including by a parent or subsidiary of the
manufacturer, if applicable, is not more than 5,000
motor vehicles.
(b)(1) In order to determine whether new motor vehicles or new
motor vehicle engines being manufactured by a manufacturer do in
fact conform with the regulations with respect to which the certifi-
cate of conformity was issued, the Administrator is authorized to
test such vehicles or engines. Such tests may be conducted by the
Administrator directly or, in accordance with conditions specified
by the Administrator, by the manufacturer.
(2)(A)(i) If, based on tests conducted under paragraph (1) on a
sample of new vehicles or engines covered by a certificate of con-
formity, the Administrator determines that all or part of the vehi-
cles or engines so covered do not conform with the regulations with
respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued and with
the requirements of section 202(a)(4), he may suspend or revoke
such certificate in whole or in part, and shall so notify the manu-
facturer. Such suspension or revocation shall apply in the case of
any new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines manufactured
after the date of such notification (or manufactured before such
date if still in the hands of the manufacturer), and shall apply until
such time as the Administrator finds that vehicles and engines
manufactured by the manufacturer do conform to such regulations
and requirements. If, during any period of suspension or revoca-
tion, the Administrator finds that a vehicle or engine actually con-
forms to such regulations and requirements, he shall issue a certifi-
cate of conformity applicable to such vehicle or engine.
(ii) If, based on tests conducted under paragraph (1) on any
new vehicle or engine, the Administrator determines that such ve-
hicle or engine does not conform with such regulations, he may sus-
pend or revoke such certificate insofar as it applies to such vehicle
or engine until such time as he finds such vehicle or engine actu-
ally so conforms with such regulations, and he shall so notify the
manufacturer.
(B)(i) At the request of any manufacturer the Administrator
shall grant such manufacturer a hearing as to whether the tests
have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been
properly applied, and make a determination on the record with re-
spect to any suspension or revocation under subparagraph (A); but
suspension or revocation under subparagraph (A) shall not be
stayed by reason of such hearing.
(ii) In any case of actual controversy as to the validity of any
determination under clause (i), the manufacturer may at any time
prior to the 60th day after such determination is made file a peti-
tion with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein
such manufacturer resides or has his principal place of business for
a judicial review of such determination. A copy of the petition shall
be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Adminis-

ministrator thereupon shall file in the court the record of the pro-
ceedings on which the Administrator based his determination, as
provided in section 2112 of title 28 of the United States Code.
(iii) If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce ad-
ditional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that
such additional evidence is material and that there were reason-
able grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the pro-
ceeding before the Administrator, the court may order such addi-
tional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to be taken before
the Administrator, in such manner and upon such terms and condi-
tions as the court may deem proper. The Administrator may modify
his findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the
additional evidence so taken and he shall file such modified or new
findings, and his recommendation, if any, for the modification or
setting aside of his original determination, with the return of such
additional evidence.
(iv) Upon the filing of the petition referred to in clause (ii), the
court shall have jurisdiction to review the order in accordance with
chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code, and to grant appropriate
relief as provided in such chapter.
(c) For purposes of enforcement of this section, officers or em-
ployees duly designated by the Administrator, upon presenting ap-
propriate credentials to the manufacturer or person in charge, are
authorized (1) to enter, at reasonable times, any plant or other es-
tablishment of such manufacturers, for the purpose of conducting
tests of vehicles of engines in the hands of the manufacturer, or (2)
to inspect at reasonable times, records, files, papers, processes, con-
trols, and facilities used by such manufacturer in conducting tests
under regulations of the Administrator. Each such inspection shall
be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness.
(d) The Administrator shall by regulation establish methods
and procedures for making tests under this section.
(e) The Administrator shall make available to the public the
results of his tests of any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine
submitted by a manufacturer under subsection (a) as promptly as
possible after the enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970
and at the beginning of each model year which begins thereafter.
Such results shall be described in such nontechnical manner as will
reasonably disclose to prospective ultimate purchasers of new
motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines the comparative per-
formance of the vehicles and engines tested in meeting the stand-
ards prescribed under section 202 of this Act.
(f) All light duty vehicles and engines manufactured during or
after model year 1984 and all light-duty trucks manufactured dur-
ing or after model year 1995 shall comply with the requirements
of section 202 of this Act regardless of the altitude at which they
are sold.
(g)(1) In the case of any class or category of heavy-duty vehi-
cles or engines to which a standard promulgated under section
202(a) of this Act applies, except as provided in paragraph (2), a
certificate of conformity shall be issued under subsection (a) and
shall not be suspended or revoked under subsection (b) for such ve-

the failure of such vehicles or engines to meet such standard if
such manufacturer pays a nonconformance penalty as provided
under regulations promulgated by the Administrator after notice
and opportunity for public hearing. In the case of motorcycles to
which such a standard applies, such a certificate may be issued
notwithstanding such failure if the manufacturer pays such a pen-
alty.
(2) No certificate of conformity may be issued under paragraph
(1) with respect to any class or category of vehicle or engine if the
degree by which the manufacturer fails to meet any standard pro-
mulgated under section 202(a) with respect to such class or cat-
egory exceeds the percentage determined under regulations pro-
mulgated by the Administrator to be practicable. Such regulations
shall require such testing of vehicle or engines being produced as
may be necessary to determine the percentage of the classes or cat-
egories of vehicles or engines which are not in compliance with the
regulations with respect to which a certificate of conformity was
issued and shall be promulgated not later than one year after the
date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977.
(3) The regulations promulgated under paragraph (1) shall, not
later than one year after the date of enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1977, provide for nonconformance penalties in
amounts determined under a formula established by the Adminis-
trator. Such penalties under such formula—
(A) may vary from pollutant-to-pollutant;
(B) may vary by class or category or vehicle or engine;
(C) shall take into account the extent to which actual emis-
sions of any air pollutant exceed allowable emissions under the
standards promulgated under section 202;
(D) shall be increased periodically in order to create incen-
tives for the development of production vehicles or engines
which achieve the required degree of emission reduction; and
(E) shall remove any competitive disadvantage to manufac-
turers whose engines or vehicles achieve the required degree of
emission reduction (including any such disadvantage arising
from the application of paragraph (4)).
(4) In any case in which a certificate of conformity has been
issued under this subsection, any warranty required under section
207(b)(2) and any action under section 207(c) shall be required to
be effective only for the emission levels which the Administrator
determines that such certificate was issued and not for the emis-
sion levels required under the applicable standard.
(5) The authorities of section 208(a) shall apply, subject to the
conditions of section 208(b), for purposes of this subsection.

COMPLIANCE BY VEHICLES AND ENGINES IN ACTUAL USE
S EC. 207. (a)(1) Effective with respect to vehicles and engines
manufactured in model years beginning more than 60 days after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970,
the manufacturer of each new motor vehicle and new motor vehicle
engine shall warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subse-
quent purchaser that such vehicle or engine is (A) designed, built,
and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with applicable
regulations under section 202, and (B) free from defects in mate-
rials and workmanship which cause such vehicle or engine to fail
to conform with applicable regulations for its useful life (as deter-
mined under section 202(d). In the case of vehicles and engines
manufactured in the model year 1995 and thereafter such warranty
shall require that the vehicle or engine is free from any such de-
fects for the warranty period provided under subsection (i). 112
(2) In the case of a motor vehicle part or motor vehicle engine
part, the manufacturer or rebuilder of such part may certify that
use of such part will not result in a failure of the vehicle or engine
to comply with emission standards promulgated under section 202.
Such certification shall be made only under such regulations as
may be promulgated by the Administrator to carry out the pur-
poses of subsection (b). The Administrator shall promulgate such
regulations no later than two years following the date of the enact-
ment of this paragraph.
(3) The cost of any part, device, or component of any light-duty
vehicle that is designed for emission control and which in the in-
structions issued pursuant to subsection (c)(3) of this section is
scheduled for replacement during the useful life of the vehicle in
order to maintain compliance with regulations under section 202 of
this Act, the failure of which shall not interfere with the normal
performance of the vehicle, and the expected retail price of which,
including installation costs, is greater than 2 percent of the sug-
gested retail price of such vehicle, shall be borne or reimbursed at
the time of replacement by the vehicle manufacturer and such re-
placement shall be provided without cost to the ultimate purchaser,
subsequent purchaser, or dealer. The term ‘‘designed for emission
control’’ as used in the preceding sentence means a catalytic con-
verter, thermal reactor, or other component installed on or in a ve-
hicle for the sole or primary purpose of reducing vehicle emissions
(not including those vehicle components which were in general use
prior to model year 1968 and the primary function of which is not
related to emission control).

under section 202 apply complies with the emission standards of
such regulations, (ii) such methods and procedures are in accord-
ance with good engineering practices, and (iii) such methods and
procedures are reasonably capable of being correlated with tests
conducted under section 206(a)(1), then—
(1) he shall establish such methods and procedures by reg-
ulation, and
(2) at such time as he determines that inspection facilities
or equipment are available for purposes of carrying out testing
methods and procedures established under paragraph (1), he
shall prescribe regulations which shall require manufacturers
to warrant the emission control device or system of each new
motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine to which a regula-
tion under section 202 applies and which is manufactured in
a model year beginning after the Administrator first prescribes
warranty regulations under this paragraph. The warranty
under such regulations shall run to the ultimate purchaser and
each subsequent purchaser and shall provide that if—
(A) the vehicle or engine is maintained and operated
in accordance with instructions under subsection (c)(3),
(B) it fails to conform at any time during its 113 the
warranty period (as determined under subsection (i)) to
the regulations prescribed under section 202, and
(C) such nonconformity results in the ultimate pur-
chaser (or any subsequent purchaser) of such vehicle or en-
gine having to bear any penalty or other sanction (includ-
ing the denial of the right to use such vehicle or engine)
under State or Federal law,
then such manufacturer shall remedy such nonconformity
under such warranty with the cost thereof to be borne by the
manufacturer. No such warranty shall be invalid on the basis
of any part used in the maintenance or repair of a vehicle or
engine if such part was certified as provided under subsection
(a)(2). øFor purposes of the warranty under this subsection, for
the period after twenty-four months or twenty-four thousand
miles (whichever first occurs) the term ‘‘emission control device
or system’’ means a catalytic converter, thermal reactor, or
other component installed on or in a vehicle for the sole or pri-
mary purpose of reducing vehicle emissions. Such terms shall
not include those vehicle components which were in general
use prior to model year 1968.¿ 114

202(d)), he shall immediately notify the manufacturer thereof
of such nonconformity, and he shall require the manufacturer
to submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity of the vehi-
cles or engines with respect to which such notification is given.
The plan shall provide that the nonconformity of any such ve-
hicles or engines which are properly used and maintained will
be remedied at the expense of the manufacturer. If the manu-
facturer disagrees with such determination of nonconformity
and so advises the Administrator, the Administrator shall af-
ford the manufacturer and other interested persons an oppor-
tunity to present their views and evidence in support thereof
at a public hearing. Unless, as a result of such hearing the Ad-
ministrator withdraws such determination of nonconformity,
he shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing,
order the manufacturer to provide prompt notification of such
nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (2).
(2) Any notification required by paragraph (1) with respect
to any class or category of vehicles or engines shall be given
to dealers, ultimate purchasers, and subsequent purchasers (if
known) in such manner and containing such information as the
Administrator may by regulations require.
(3)(A) 115 The manufacturer shall furnish with each new motor
vehicle or motor vehicle engine written instructions for the proper
maintenance and use of the vehicle or engine by the ultimate pur-
chaser and such instructions shall correspond to regulations which
the Administrator shall promulgate. The manufacturer shall pro-
vide in boldface type on the first page of the written maintenance
instructions notice that maintenance, replacement, or repair of the
emission control devices and systems may be performed by any
automotive repair establishment or individual using any auto-
motive part which has been certified as provided in subsection
(a)(2).
(B) The instruction under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph
shall not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser’s using,
in connection with such vehicle or engine, any component or service
(other than a component or service provided without charge under
the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand,
trade, or corporate name; or directly or indirectly distinguishing be-
tween service performed by the franchised dealers of such manufac-
turer or any other service establishments with which such manu-
facturer has a commercial relationship, and service performed by
independent automotive repair facilities with which such manufac-
turer has no commercial relationship; except that the prohibition of
this subsection 116 may be waived by the Administrator if—
(i) the manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the
vehicle or engine will function properly only if the component
or service so identified is used in connection with such vehicle
or engine, and
(ii) the Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the
public interest.

(i) 120 WARRANTY PERIOD.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of subsection (a)(1) and
subsection (b), the warranty period, effective with respect to
new light-duty trucks and new light-duty vehicles and engines,
manufactured in the model year 1995 and thereafter, shall be
the first 2 years or 24,000 miles of use (whichever first occurs),
except as provided in paragraph (2). For purposes of subsection
(a)(1) and subsection (b), for other vehicles and engines the
warranty period shall be the period established by the Admin-
istrator by regulation (promulgated prior to the enactment of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) for such purposes un-
less the Administrator subsequently modifies such regulation.
(2) SPECIFIED MAJOR EMISSION CONTROL COMPONENTS.—In
the case of a specified major emission control component, the

vehicles and engines manufactured in the model year 1995 and
thereafter for purposes of subsection (a)(1) and subsection (b)
shall be 8 years or 80,000 miles of use (whichever first occurs).
As used in this paragraph, the term ‘‘specified major emission
control component’’ means only a catalytic converter, an elec-
tronic emissions control unit, and an onboard emissions diag-
nostic device, except that the Administrator may designate any
other pollution control device or component as a specified
major emission control component if—
(A) the device or component was not in general use on
vehicles and engines manufactured prior to the model year
1990; and
(B) the Administrator determines that the retail cost
(exclusive of installation costs) of such device or component
exceeds $200 (in 1989 dollars), adjusted for inflation or de-
flation as calculated by the Administrator at the time of
such determination.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘‘onboard emissions
diagnostic device’’ means any device installed for the purpose
of storing or processing emissions related diagnostic informa-
tion, but not including any parts or other systems which it

STATE STANDARDS
S EC. 209. (a) No State or any political subdivision thereof shall
adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the control of
emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines
subject to this part. No State shall require certification, inspection,
or any other approval relating to the control of emissions from any
new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine as condition prece-
dent to the initial retail sale, titling (if any), or registration of such
motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, or equipment.
(b)(1) The Administrator shall, after notice and opportunity for
public hearing, waive application of this section to any State which
has adopted standards (other than crankcase emission standards)
for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor
vehicle engines prior to March 30, 1966, if the State determines
that the State standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as pro-
tective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal stand-
ards. No such waiver shall be granted if the Administrator finds
that— (A) the determination of the State is arbitrary and capri-
cious,
(B) such State does not need such State standards to meet
compelling and extraordinary conditions, or
(C) such State standards and accompanying enforcement
procedures are not consistent with section 202(a) of this part.
(2) If each State standard is at least as stringent as the com-
parable applicable Federal standard, such State standard shall be
deemed to be at least as protective of health and welfare as such
Federal standards for purposes of paragraph (1).
(3) In the case of any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle
engine to which State standards apply pursuant to a waiver grant-
ed under paragraph (1), compliance with such State standards
shall be treated as compliance with applicable Federal standards
for purposes of this title.
(c) Whenever a regulation with respect to any motor vehicle
part or motor vehicle engine part is in effect under section
207(a)(2), no State or political subdivision thereof shall adopt or at-
tempt to enforce any standard or any requirement of certification,
inspection, or approval which relates to motor vehicle emissions
and is applicable to the same aspect of such part. The preceding
sentence shall not apply in the case of a State with respect to
which a waiver is in effect under subsection (b).
(d) Nothing in this part shall preclude or deny to any State or
political subdivision thereof the right otherwise to control, regulate,
or restrict the use, operation, or movement of registered or licensed
motor vehicles.

or any political subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to
enforce any standard or other requirement relating to the con-
trol of emissions from either of the following new nonroad en-
gines or nonroad vehicles subject to regulation under this
Act—
(A) New engines which are used in construction equip-
ment or vehicles or used in farm equipment or vehicles
and which are smaller than 175 horsepower.
(B) New locomotives or new engines used in loco-

case of any nonroad vehicles or engines other than those re-
ferred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), the Ad-
ministrator shall, after notice and opportunity for public hear-
ing, authorize California to adopt and enforce standards and
other requirements relating to the control of emissions from
such vehicles or engines if California determines that Cali-
fornia standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective
of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.
No such authorization shall be granted if the Administrator
finds that—
(i) the determination of California is arbitrary and ca-
pricious,
(ii) California does not need such California standards
to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, or
(iii) California standards and accompanying enforce-
ment procedures are not consistent with this section.
(B) Any State other than California which has plan provi-
sions approved under part D of title I may adopt and enforce,
after notice to the Administrator, for any period, standards re-
lating to control of emissions from nonroad vehicles or engines
(other than those referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of
paragraph (1)) and take such other actions as are referred to
in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph respecting such vehicles
or engines if—
(i) such standards and implementation and enforce-
ment are identical, for the period concerned, to the Cali-
fornia standards authorized by the Administrator under
subparagraph (A), and
(ii) California and such State adopt such standards at
least 2 years before commencement of the period for which
the standards take effect.
The Administrator shall issue regulations to implement this

tial. (3) Upon compliance with the provisions of this subsection, in-
cluding assurances that the Administrator will receive changes in
the information required, the Administrator shall register such fuel
or fuel additive.
(4) STUDY ON CERTAIN FUEL ADDITIVES AND
BLENDSTOCKS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 2 years after the date
of enactment of this paragraph, the Administrator shall—
(i) conduct a study on the effects on public health
(including the effects on children, pregnant women,
minority or low-income communities, and other sen-
sitive populations), air quality, and water resources of

ance of any emission control device or system which is in general
use, or which the Administrator finds has been developed to a point
where in a reasonable time it would be in general use were such
regulation to be promulgated.
(2)(A) No fuel, class of fuels, or fuel additive may be controlled
or prohibited by the Administrator pursuant to clause (A) of para-
graph (1) except after consideration of all relevant medical and sci-
entific evidence available to him, including consideration of other
technologically or economically feasible means of achieving emis-
sion standards under section 202.
(B) No fuel or fuel additive may be controlled or prohibited by
the Administrator pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph (1) except
after consideration of available scientific and economic data, includ-
ing a cost benefit analysis comparing emission control devices or
systems which are or will be in general use and require the pro-
posed control or prohibition with emission control devices or sys-
tems which are or will be in general use and do not require the
proposed control or prohibition. On request of a manufacturer of
motor vehicles, motor vehicle engines, fuels, or fuel additives sub-
mitted within 10 days of notice of proposed rulemaking, the Admin-
istrator shall hold a public hearing and publish findings with re-
spect to any matter he is required to consider under this subpara-
graph. Such findings shall be published at the time of promulgation
of final regulations.
(C) No fuel or fuel additive may be prohibited by the Adminis-
trator under paragraph (1) unless he finds, and publishes such
finding, that in his judgment such prohibition will not cause the
use of any other fuel or fuel additive which will produce emissions
which will endanger the public health or welfare to the same or
greater degree than the use of the fuel or fuel additive proposed to
be prohibited.
(3)(A) For the purpose of obtaining evidence and data to carry
out paragraph (2), the Administrator may require the manufac-
turer of any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine to furnish any
information which has been developed concerning the emissions
from motor vehicles resulting from the use of any fuel or fuel addi-
tive, or the effect of such use on the performance of any emission
control device or system.

bition of the characteristic or component of a fuel or fuel addi-
tive under paragraph (1) is necessary and has published his
finding in the Federal Register, or
(ii) if the Administrator has prescribed under paragraph
(1) a control or prohibition applicable to such characteristic or
component of a fuel or fuel additive, unless State prohibition
or control is identical to the prohibition or control prescribed
by the Administrator.
(B) Any State for which application of section 209(a) has at any
time been waived under section 209(b) may at any time prescribe
and enforce, for the purpose of motor vehicle emission control, a
control or prohibition respecting any fuel or fuel additive.
(C)(i) A State may prescribe and enforce, for purposes of motor
vehicle emission control, a control or prohibition respecting the use
of a fuel or fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine
if an applicable implementation plan for such State under section
110 so provides. The Administrator may approve such provision in
an implementation plan, or promulgate an implementation plan
containing such a provision, only if he finds that the State control
or prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primary or sec-
ondary ambient air quality standard which the plan implements.
The Administrator may find that a State control or prohibition is
necessary to achieve that standard if no other measures that would
bring about timely attainment exist, or if other measures exist and
are technically possible to implement, but are unreasonable or im-
practicable. The Administrator may make a finding of necessity
under this subparagraph even if the plan for the area does not con-
tain an approved demonstration of timely attainment.
(ii) The Administrator may temporarily waive a control or pro-
hibition respecting the use of a fuel or fuel additive required or reg-
ulated by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (c), (h), (i), (k),
or (m) of this section or prescribed in an applicable implementation
plan under section 110 approved by the Administrator under clause
(i) of this subparagraph if, after consultation with, and concurrence
by, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator determines that—
(I) extreme and unusual fuel or fuel additive supply cir-
cumstances exist in a State or region of the Nation which pre-
vent the distribution of an adequate supply of the fuel or fuel
additive to consumers;
(II) such extreme and unusual fuel and fuel additive sup-
ply circumstances are the result of a natural disaster, an Act
of God, a pipeline or refinery equipment failure, or another
event that could not reasonably have been foreseen or pre-
vented and not the lack of prudent planning on the part of the
suppliers of the fuel or fuel additive to such State or region;
and (III) it is in the public interest to grant the waiver (for ex-
ample, when a waiver is necessary to meet projected temporary
shortfalls in the supply of the fuel or fuel additive in a State
or region of the Nation which cannot otherwise be compensated
for).

identical to a Federal fuel formulation implemented by the Admin-
istrator, but the Administrator shall not reduce the total number
of fuels authorized under the list published under subclause (II).
(IV) Subclause (I) shall not limit the Administrator’s authority
to approve a control or prohibition respecting any new fuel under
this paragraph in a State implementation plan or revision to a
State implementation plan if such new fuel—
(aa) completely replaces a fuel on the list published under
subclause (II); or
(bb) does not increase the total number of fuels on the list
published under subclause (II) as of September 1, 2004.
In the event that the total number of fuels on the list published
under subclause (II) at the time of the Administrator’s consider-
ation of a control or prohibition respecting a new fuel is lower than
the total number of fuels on such list as of September 1, 2004, the
Administrator may approve a control or prohibition respecting a
new fuel under this subclause if the Administrator, after consulta-
tion with the Secretary of Energy, publishes in the Federal Reg-
ister after notice and comment a finding that, in the Administra-
tor’s judgment, such control or prohibition respecting a new fuel
will not cause fuel supply or distribution interruptions or have a
significant adverse impact on fuel producibility in the affected area
or contiguous areas.
(V) The Administrator shall have no authority under this para-
graph, when considering any particular State’s implementation
plan or a revision to that State’s implementation plan, to approve
any fuel unless that fuel was, as of the date of such consideration,
approved in at least one State implementation plan in the applica-
ble Petroleum Administration for Defense District. However, the
Administrator may approve as part of a State implementation plan
or State implementation plan revision a fuel with a summertime
Reid Vapor Pressure of 7.0 psi. In no event shall such approval by
the Administrator cause an increase in the total number of fuels
on the list published under subclause (II).
(VI) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to have any ef-
fect regarding any available authority of States to require the use
of any fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b), in-
cluding any fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection
(b) after the enactment of this subclause.
(d) PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIONS.—
(1) CIVIL PENALTIES.—Any person who violates subsection

with subsections (b) and (c) of section 205.
(2) INJUNCTIVE AUTHORITY.—The district courts of the
United States shall have jurisdiction to restrain violations of
subsections (a), (f), (g), (k), (l), (m), (n), and (o) of this section
and of the regulations prescribed under subsections (c), (h), (i),
(k), (l), (m), (n), and (o) of this section, to award other appro-
priate relief, and to compel the furnishing of information and
the conduct of tests required by the Administrator under sub-
section (b) of this section. Actions to restrain such violations
and compel such actions shall be brought by and in the name
of the United States. In any such action, subpoenas for wit-
nesses who are required to attend a district court in any dis-
trict may run into any other district.
(e)(1) Not later than one year after the date of enactment of
this subsection and after notice and opportunity for a public hear-
ing, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations which imple-
ment the authority under subsection (b)(2) (A) and (B) with respect
to each fuel or fuel additive which is registered on the date of pro-
mulgation of such regulations and with respect to each fuel or fuel
additive for which an application for registration is filed thereafter.
(2) Regulations under subsection (b) to carry out this sub-
section shall require that the requisite information be provided to
the Administrator by each such manufacturer—
(A) prior to registration, in the case of any fuel or fuel ad-
ditive which is not registered on the date of promulgation of
such regulations; or
(B) not later than three years after the date of promulga-
tion of such regulations, in the case of any fuel or fuel additive
which is registered on such date.
(3) In promulgating such regulations, the Administrator may—
(A) exempt any small business (as defined in such regula-
tions) from or defer or modify the requirements of, such regula-
tions with respect to any such small business;
(B) provide for cost-sharing with respect to the testing of
any fuel or fuel additive which is manufactured or processed
by two or more persons or otherwise provide for shared respon-
sibility to meet the requirements of this section without dupli-
cation; or
(C) exempt any person from such regulations with respect
to a particular fuel or fuel additive upon a finding that any ad-
ditional testing of such fuel or fuel additive would be duplica-
tive of adequate existing testing.
(f)(1)(A) Effective upon March 31, 1977, it shall be unlawful for
any manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive to first introduce into
commerce, or to increase the concentration in use of, any fuel or
fuel additive for general use in light duty motor vehicles manufac-
tured after model year 1974 which is not substantially similar to

(3) Any manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive which prior
to March 31, 1977, and after January 1, 1974, first introduced into
commerce or increased the concentration in use of a fuel or fuel ad-
ditive that would otherwise have been prohibited under paragraph
(1)(A) if introduced on or after March 31, 1977 shall, not later than
September 15, 1978, cease to distribute such fuel or fuel additive
in commerce. During the period beginning 180 days after the date
of the enactment of this subsection and before September 15, 1978,
the Administrator shall prohibit, or restrict the concentration of
any fuel additive which he determines will cause or contribute to
the failure of an emission control device or system (over the useful
life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to
achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards with
respect to which it has been certified under section 206.
(4) The Administrator, upon application of any manufacturer of
any fuel or fuel additive, may waive the prohibitions established
under paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection or the limitation speci-
fied in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if he determines that the
applicant has established that such fuel or fuel additive or a speci-
fied concentration thereof, and the emission products of such fuel
or fuel additive or specified concentration thereof, will not cause or
contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system
(over the useful life of the motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine,
nonroad engine or nonroad vehicle in which such device or system
is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle or engine with the
emission standards with respect to which it has been certified pur-
suant to sections 206 and 213(a). The Administrator shall take
final action to grant or deny an application submitted under this
paragraph, after public notice and comment, within 270 days of the
receipt of such an application.
(5) No action of the Administrator under this section may be
stayed by any court pending judicial review of such action.
(g) MISFUELING.—(1) No person shall introduce, or cause or
allow the introduction of, leaded gasoline into any motor vehicle
which is labeled ‘‘unleaded gasoline only,’’ which is equipped with

(i)(2).
(h) REID VAPOR PRESSURE REQUIREMENTS.—
(1) PROHIBITION.—Not later than 6 months after the date
of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
the Administrator shall promulgate regulations making it un-
lawful for any person during the high ozone season (as defined
by the Administrator) to sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply,
offer for supply, transport, or introduce into commerce gasoline
with a Reid Vapor Pressure in excess of 9.0 pounds per square
inch (psi). Such regulations shall also establish more stringent
Reid Vapor Pressure standards in a nonattainment area as the
Administrator finds necessary to generally achieve comparable
evaporative emissions (on a per-vehicle basis) in nonattain-
ment areas, taking into consideration the enforceability of such
standards, the need of an area for emission control, and eco-
nomic factors.
(2) ATTAINMENT AREAS.—The regulations under this sub-
section shall not make it unlawful for any person to sell, offer
for supply, transport, or introduce into commerce gasoline with
a Reid Vapor Pressure of 9.0 pounds per square inch (psi) or
lower in any area designated under section 107 as an attain-
ment area. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Ad-
ministrator may impose a Reid vapor pressure requirement
lower than 9.0 pounds per square inch (psi) in any area, for-
merly an ozone nonattainment area, which has been redesig-
nated as an attainment area.
(3) EFFECTIVE DATE; ENFORCEMENT.—The regulations
under this subsection shall provide that the requirements of
this subsection shall take effect not later than the high ozone
season for 1992, and shall include such provisions as the Ad-
ministrator determines are necessary to implement and enforce
the requirements of this subsection.
(4) ETHANOL WAIVER.—For fuel blends containing gasoline
and 10 percent denatured anhydrous ethanol, the Reid vapor
pressure limitation under this subsection shall be one pound
per square inch (psi) greater than the applicable Reid vapor
pressure limitations established under paragraph (1); Provided,
however, That a distributor, blender, marketer, reseller, car-
rier, retailer, or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall be
deemed to be in full compliance with the provisions of this sub-
section and the regulations promulgated thereunder if it can
demonstrate (by showing receipt of a certification or other evi-
dence acceptable to the Administrator) that—
(A) the gasoline portion of the blend complies with the
Reid vapor pressure limitations promulgated pursuant to
this subsection;
(B) the ethanol portion of the blend does not exceed its
waiver condition under subsection (f)(4); and
(C) no additional alcohol or other additive has been
added to increase the Reid Vapor Pressure of the ethanol
portion of the blend.

(A) PROMULGATION OF REGULATIONS.—Upon notifica-
tion, accompanied by supporting documentation, from the
Governor of a State that the Reid vapor pressure limita-
tion established by paragraph (4) will increase emissions
that contribute to air pollution in any area in the State,
the Administrator shall, by regulation, apply, in lieu of the
Reid vapor pressure limitation established by paragraph
(4), the Reid vapor pressure limitation established by para-
graph (1) to all fuel blends containing gasoline and 10 per-
cent denatured anhydrous ethanol that are sold, offered for
sale, dispensed, supplied, offered for supply, transported,
or introduced into commerce in the area during the high
ozone season.
(B) D EADLINE FOR PROMULGATION.—The Administrator
shall promulgate regulations under subparagraph (A) not
later than 90 days after the date of receipt of a notification
from a Governor under that subparagraph.
(C) EFFECTIVE DATE.—
(i) I N GENERAL.—With respect to an area in a
State for which the Governor submits a notification
under subparagraph (A), the regulations under that
subparagraph shall take effect on the later of—
(I) the first day of the first high ozone season
for the area that begins after the date of receipt
of the notification; or
(II) 1 year after the date of receipt of the noti-
fication.
(ii) EXTENSION OF EFFECTIVE DATE BASED ON DE-
TERMINATION OF INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY.—
(I) IN GENERAL.—If, after receipt of a notifica-
tion with respect to an area from a Governor of a
State under subparagraph (A), the Administrator
determines, on the Administrator’s own motion or
on petition of any person and after consultation
with the Secretary of Energy, that the promulga-
tion of regulations described in subparagraph (A)
would result in an insufficient supply of gasoline
in the State, the Administrator, by regulation—
(aa) shall extend the effective date of the
regulations under clause (i) with respect to
the area for not more than 1 year; and
(bb) may renew the extension under item
(aa) for two additional periods, each of which
shall not exceed 1 year.

sulfur in excess of 0.05 percent (by weight) or which fails to meet
a cetane index minimum of 40.
(2) Not later than 12 months after the date of the enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall
promulgate regulations to implement and enforce the requirements
of paragraph (1). The Administrator may require manufacturers
and importers of diesel fuel not intended for use in motor vehicles
to dye such fuel in a particular manner in order to segregate it
from motor vehicle diesel fuel. The Administrator may establish an
equivalent alternative aromatic level to the cetane index specifica-
tion in paragraph (1).
(3) The sulfur content of fuel required to be used in the certifi-
cation of 1991 through 1993 model year heavy-duty diesel vehicles

exemption from the requirements of this subsection, within 12
months from the date of the petition.
(j) L EAD SUBSTITUTE GASOLINE ADDITIVES.—(1) After the date
of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, any
person proposing to register any gasoline additive under subsection
(a) or to use any previously registered additive as a lead substitute
may also elect to register the additive as a lead substitute gasoline
additive for reducing valve seat wear by providing the Adminis-
trator with such relevant information regarding product identity
and composition as the Administrator deems necessary for carrying
out the responsibilities of paragraph (2) of this subsection (in addi-
tion to other information which may be required under subsection
(b)). (2) In addition to the other testing which may be required
under subsection (b), in the case of the lead substitute gasoline ad-
ditives referred to in paragraph (1), the Administrator shall de-
velop and publish a test procedure to determine the additives’ effec-
tiveness in reducing valve seat wear and the additives’ tendencies
to produce engine deposits and other adverse side effects. The test
procedures shall be developed in cooperation with the Secretary of
Agriculture and with the input of additive manufacturers, engine
and engine components manufacturers, and other interested per-
sons. The Administrator shall enter into arrangements with an
independent laboratory to conduct tests of each additive using the
test procedures developed and published pursuant to this para-

rank or otherwise rate the lead substitute additives. Test proce-
dures shall be established within 1 year after the date of the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Additives shall be
tested within 18 months of the date of the enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 or 6 months after the lead substitute
additives are identified to the Administrator, whichever is later.
(3) The Administrator may impose a user fee to recover the
costs of testing of any fuel additive referred to in this subsection.
The fee shall be paid by the person proposing to register the fuel
additive concerned. Such fee shall not exceed $20,000 for a single
fuel additive.
(4) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Adminis-
trator not more than $1,000,000 for the second full fiscal year after
the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 to establish test procedures and conduct engine tests as pro-
vided in this subsection. Not more than $500,000 per year is au-
thorized to be appropriated for each of the 5 subsequent fiscal
years.
(5) Any fees collected under this subsection shall be deposited
in a special fund in the United States Treasury for licensing and
other services which thereafter shall be available for appropriation,
to remain available until expended, to carry out the Agency’s ac-
tivities for which the fees were collected.
(k) REFORMULATED GASOLINE FOR CONVENTIONAL VEHICLES.—
(1) EPA REGULATIONS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than November 15, 1991,
the Administrator shall promulgate regulations under this
section establishing requirements for reformulated gaso-
line to be used in gasoline-fueled vehicles in specified non-
attainment areas. Such regulations shall require the great-
est reduction in emissions of ozone forming volatile organic
compounds (during the high ozone season) and emissions
of toxic air pollutants (during the entire year) achievable
through the reformulation of conventional gasoline, taking
into consideration the cost of achieving such emission re-
ductions, any nonair-quality and other air-quality related
health and environmental impacts and energy require-
ments.
(B) MAINTENANCE OF TOXIC AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS
REDUCTIONS FROM REFORMULATED GASOLINE.—
(i) DEFINITION OF PADD.—In this subparagraph
the term ‘‘PADD’’ means a Petroleum Administration
for Defense District.
(ii) REGULATIONS CONCERNING EMISSIONS OF TOXIC
AIR POLLUTANTS.—Not later than 270 days after the
date of enactment of this subparagraph, the Adminis-
trator shall establish by regulation, for each refinery
or importer (other than a refiner or importer in a
State that has received a waiver under section 209(b)
with respect to gasoline produced for use in that
State), standards for toxic air pollutants from use of
the reformulated gasoline produced or distributed by
the refiner or importer that maintain the reduction of

pollutants for reformulated gasoline produced or dis-
tributed by the refiner or importer during calendar
years 2001 and 2002 (as determined on the basis of
data collected by the Administrator with respect to the
refiner or importer).
(iii) STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC REFIN-
ERIES OR IMPORTERS.—
(I) A PPLICABILITY OF STANDARDS.—For any
calendar year, the standards applicable to a re-
finer or importer under clause (ii) shall apply to
the quantity of gasoline produced or distributed by
the refiner or importer in the calendar year only
to the extent that the quantity is less than or
equal to the average annual quantity of reformu-
lated gasoline produced or distributed by the re-
finer or importer during calendar years 2001 and
2002.
(II) APPLICABILITY OF OTHER STANDARDS.—For
any calendar year, the quantity of gasoline pro-
duced or distributed by a refiner or importer that
is in excess of the quantity subject to subclause (I)
shall be subject to standards for emissions of toxic
air pollutants promulgated under subparagraph
(A) and paragraph (3)(B).
(iv) CREDIT PROGRAM.—The Administrator shall
provide for the granting and use of credits for emis-
sions of toxic air pollutants in the same manner as
provided in paragraph (7).
(v) REGIONAL PROTECTION OF TOXICS REDUCTION
BASELINES.—
(I) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days after
the date of enactment of this subparagraph, and
not later than April 1 of each calendar year that
begins after that date of enactment, the Adminis-
trator shall publish in the Federal Register a re-
port that specifies, with respect to the previous
calendar year—
(aa) the quantity of reformulated gasoline
produced that is in excess of the average an-
nual quantity of reformulated gasoline pro-
duced in 2001 and 2002; and
(bb) the reduction of the average annual
aggregate emissions of toxic air pollutants in
each PADD, based on retail survey data or
data from other appropriate sources.
(II) EFFECT OF FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AGGRE-
GATE TOXICS REDUCTIONS.—If, in any calendar
year, the reduction of the average annual aggre-
gate emissions of toxic air pollutants in a PADD
fails to meet or exceed the reduction of the aver-
age annual aggregate emissions of toxic air pollut-
ants in the PADD in calendar years 2001 and

(aa) identify, to the maximum extent
practicable, the reasons for the failure, includ-
ing the sources, volumes, and characteristics
of reformulated gasoline that contributed to
the failure; and
(bb) promulgate revisions to the regula-
tions promulgated under clause (ii), to take ef-
fect not earlier than 180 days but not later
than 270 days after the date of promulgation,
to provide that, notwithstanding clause
(iii)(II), all reformulated gasoline produced or
distributed at each refiner or importer shall
meet the standards applicable under clause
(iii)(I) beginning not later than April 1 of the
calendar year following publication of the re-
port under subclause (I) and in each calendar
year thereafter.
(vi) Not later than July 1, 2007, the Administrator
shall promulgate final regulations to control haz-
ardous air pollutants from motor vehicles and motor
vehicle fuels, as provided for in section 80.1045 of title
40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the
date of enactment of this subparagraph), and as au-
thorized under section 202(1) 124 of the Clean Air Act.
If the Administrator promulgates by such date, final
regulations to control hazardous air pollutants from
motor vehicles and motor vehicle fuels that achieve
and maintain greater overall reductions in emissions
of air toxics from reformulated gasoline than the re-
ductions that would be achieved under section
211(k)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act as amended by this
clause, then sections 211(k)(1)(B)(i) through
211(k)(1)(B)(v) shall be null and void and regulations
promulgated thereunder shall be rescinded and have
no further effect.
(2) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.—The regulations referred to
in paragraph (1) shall require that reformulated gasoline com-
ply with paragraph (3) and with each of the following require-
ments (subject to paragraph (7)):
(A) NOxEMISSIONS.—The emissions of oxides of nitro-
gen (NOx) from baseline vehicles when using the reformu-
lated gasoline shall be no greater than the level of such
emissions from such vehicles when using baseline gasoline.
If the Administrator determines that compliance with the
limitation on emissions of oxides of nitrogen under the pre-
ceding sentence is technically infeasible, considering the
other requirements applicable under this subsection to

waive entirely), any other requirements of this paragraph
or any requirements applicable under paragraph (3)(A).
(B) BENZENE CONTENT.—The benzene content of the
gasoline shall not exceed 1.0 percent by volume.
(C) H EAVY METALS.—The gasoline shall have no heavy
metals, including lead or manganese. The Administrator
may waive the prohibition contained in this subparagraph
for a heavy metal (other than lead) if the Administrator
determines that addition of the heavy metal to the gaso-
line will not increase, on an aggregate mass or cancer-risk
basis, toxic air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles.
(3) MORE STRINGENT OF FORMULA OR PERFORMANCE STAND-
ARDS.—The regulations referred to in paragraph (1) shall re-
quire compliance with the more stringent of either the require-
ments set forth in subparagraph (A) or the requirements of
subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. For purposes of deter-
mining the more stringent provision, clause (i) and clause (ii)
of subparagraph (B) shall be considered independently.
(A) FORMULA.—
(i) BENZENE.—The benzene content of the refor-
mulated gasoline shall not exceed 1.0 percent by vol-
ume.
(ii) AROMATICS.—The aromatic hydrocarbon con-
tent of the reformulated gasoline shall not exceed 25
percent by volume.
(iii) LEAD.—The reformulated gasoline shall have
no lead content.
(iv) DETERGENTS.—The reformulated gasoline
shall contain additives to prevent the accumulation of
deposits in engines or vehicle fuel supply systems.
(B) PERFORMANCE STANDARD.—
(i) VOC EMISSIONS.—During the high ozone season
(as defined by the Administrator), the aggregate emis-
sions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds
from baseline vehicles when using the reformulated
gasoline shall be 15 percent below the aggregate emis-
sions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds
from such vehicles when using baseline gasoline. Ef-
fective in calendar year 2000 and thereafter, 25 per-
cent shall be substituted for 15 percent in applying
this clause, except that the Administrator may adjust
such 25 percent requirement to provide for a lesser or
greater reduction based on technological feasibility,
considering the cost of achieving such reductions in
VOC emissions. No such adjustment shall provide for
less than a 20 percent reduction below the aggregate
emissions of such air pollutants from such vehicles
when using baseline gasoline. The reductions required
under this clause shall be on a mass basis.
(ii) TOXICS.—During the entire year, the aggregate
emissions of toxic air pollutants from baseline vehicles
when using the reformulated gasoline shall be 15 per-
cent below the aggregate emissions of toxic air pollut-
ants from such vehicles when using baseline gasoline.

Effective in calendar year 2000 and thereafter, 25 per-
cent shall be substituted for 15 percent in applying
this clause, except that the Administrator may adjust
such 25 percent requirement to provide for a lesser or
greater reduction based on technological feasibility,
considering the cost of achieving such reductions in
toxic air pollutants. No such adjustment shall provide
for less than a 20 percent reduction below the aggre-
gate emissions of such air pollutants from such vehi-
cles when using baseline gasoline. The reductions re-
quired under this clause shall be on a mass basis.
Any reduction greater than a specific percentage reduction re-
quired under this subparagraph shall be treated as satisfying
such percentage reduction requirement.
(4) CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES.—
(A) REGULATIONS.—The regulations under this sub-
section shall include procedures under which the Adminis-
trator shall certify reformulated gasoline as complying
with the requirements established pursuant to this sub-
section. Under such regulations, the Administrator shall
establish procedures for any person to petition the Admin-
istrator to certify a fuel formulation, or slate of fuel formu-
lations. Such procedures shall further require that the Ad-
ministrator shall approve or deny such petition within 180
days of receipt. If the Administrator fails to act within
such 180-day period, the fuel shall be deemed certified
until the Administrator completes action on the petition.
(B) CERTIFICATION; EQUIVALENCY.—The Administrator
shall certify a fuel formulation or slate of fuel formulations
as complying with this subsection if such fuel or fuels—
(i) comply with the requirements of paragraph (2),
and
(ii) achieve equivalent or greater reductions in
emissions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds
and emissions of toxic air pollutants than are achieved
by a reformulated gasoline meeting the applicable re-
quirements of paragraph (3).
(C) EPA DETERMINATION OF EMISSIONS LEVEL.—Within
1 year after the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, the Administrator shall determine the level
of emissions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds
and emissions of toxic air pollutants emitted by baseline
vehicles when operating on baseline gasoline. For purposes
of this subsection, within 1 year after the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator
shall, by rule, determine appropriate measures of, and
methodology for, ascertaining the emissions of air pollut-
ants (including calculations, equipment, and testing toler-
ances).
(5) PROHIBITION.—Effective beginning January 1, 1995,
each of the following shall be a violation of this subsection:
(A) The sale or dispensing by any person of conven-
tional gasoline to ultimate consumers in any covered area.

(B) The sale or dispensing by any refiner, blender, im-
porter, or marketer of conventional gasoline for resale in
any covered area, without (i) segregating such gasoline
from reformulated gasoline, and (ii) clearly marking such
conventional gasoline as ‘‘conventional gasoline, not for
sale to ultimate consumer in a covered area’’.
Any refiner, blender, importer or marketer who purchases
property segregated and marked conventional gasoline, and
thereafter labels, represents, or wholesales such gasoline as re-
formulated gasoline shall also be in violation of this subsection.
The Administrator may impose sampling, testing, and record-
keeping requirements upon any refiner, blender, importer, or
marketer to prevent violations of this section.
(6) OPT-IN AREAS.—
(A) CLASSIFIED AREAS.—
(i) I N GENERAL.—Upon the application of the Gov-
ernor of a State, the Administrator shall apply the
prohibition set forth in paragraph (5) in any area in
the State classified under subpart 2 of part D of title
I as a Marginal, Moderate, Serious, or Severe Area
(without regard to whether or not the 1980 population
of the area exceeds 250,000). In any such case, the Ad-
ministrator shall establish an effective date for such
prohibition as he deems appropriate, not later than
January 1, 1995, or 1 year after such application is re-
ceived, whichever is later. The Administrator shall
publish such application in the Federal Register upon
receipt.
(ii) EFFECT OF INSUFFICIENT DOMESTIC CAPACITY
TO PRODUCE REFORMULATED GASOLINE.—If the Admin-
istrator determines, on the Administrator’s own mo-
tion or on petition of any person, after consultation
with the Secretary of Energy, that there is insufficient
domestic capacity to produce gasoline certified under
this subsection, the Administrator shall, by rule, ex-
tend the effective date of such prohibition in Marginal,
Moderate, Serious, or Severe Areas referred to in
clause (i) for one additional year, and may, by rule,
renew such extension for 2 additional one-year peri-
ods. The Administrator shall act on any petition sub-
mitted under this subparagraph within 6 months after
receipt of the petition. The Administrator shall issue
such extensions for areas with a lower ozone classifica-
tion before issuing any such extension for areas with
a higher classification.
(B) OZONE TRANSPORT REGION.—
(i) APPLICATION OF PROHIBITION.—
(I) IN GENERAL.—On application of the Gov-
ernor of a State in the ozone transport region es-
tablished by section 184(a), the Administrator, not

subpart 2 of part D of title I) unless the Adminis-
trator determines under clause (iii) that there is
insufficient capacity to supply reformulated gaso-
line.
(II) PUBLICATION OF APPLICATION.—As soon as
practicable after the date of receipt of an applica-
tion under subclause (I), the Administrator shall
publish the application in the Federal Register.
(ii) PERIOD OF APPLICABILITY.—Under clause (i),
the prohibition specified in paragraph (5) shall apply
in a State—
(I) commencing as soon as practicable but not
later than 2 years after the date of approval by
the Administrator of the application of the Gov-
ernor of the State; and
(II) ending not earlier than 4 years after the
commencement date determined under subclause
(I).
(iii) EXTENSION OF COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED
ON INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY.—
(I) IN GENERAL.—If, after receipt of an appli-
cation from a Governor of a State under clause (i),
the Administrator determines, on the Administra-
tor’s own motion or on petition of any person,
after consultation with the Secretary of Energy,
that there is insufficient capacity to supply refor-
mulated gasoline, the Administrator, by regula-
tion—
(aa) shall extend the commencement date
with respect to the State under clause (ii)(I)
for not more than 1 year; and
(bb) may renew the extension under item
(aa) for 2 additional periods, each of which
shall not exceed 1 year.
(II) DEADLINE FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS.—The
Administrator shall act on any petition submitted
under subclause (I) not later than 180 days after
the date of receipt of the petition.
(7) CREDITS.—(A) The regulations promulgated under this
subsection shall provide for the granting of an appropriate
amount of credits to a person who refines, blends, or imports
and certifies a gasoline or slate of gasoline that—
(i) has an aromatic hydrocarbon content (by volume)
that is less than the maximum aromatic hydrocarbon con-
tent required to comply with paragraph (3); or
(ii) has a benzene content (by volume) that is less than
the maximum benzene content specified in paragraph (2).
(B) The regulations described in subparagraph (A) shall
also provide that a person who is granted credits may use such
credits, or transfer all or a portion of such credits to another
person for use within the same nonattainment area, for the
purpose of complying with this subsection.

(C) The regulations promulgated under subparagraphs (A)
and (B) shall ensure the enforcement of the requirements for
the issuance, application, and transfer of the credits. Such reg-
ulations shall prohibit the granting or transfer of such credits
for use with respect to any gasoline in a nonattainment area,
to the extent the use of such credits would result in any of the
following:
(i) An average gasoline aromatic hydrocarbon content
(by volume) for the nonattainment (taking into account all
gasoline sold for use in conventional gasoline-fueled vehi-
cles in the nonattainment area) higher than the average
fuel aromatic hydrocarbon content (by volume) that would
occur in the absence of using any such credits.
(ii) An average benzene content (by volume) for the
nonattainment area (taking into account all gasoline sold
for use in conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles in the non-
attainment area) higher than the average benzene content
(by volume) that would occur in the absence of using any
such credits.
(8) ANTI-DUMPING RULES.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Within 1 year after the enactment of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator
shall promulgate regulations applicable to each refiner,
blender, or importer of gasoline ensuring that gasoline sold
or introduced into commerce by such refiner, blender, or
importer (other than reformulated gasoline subject to the
requirements of paragraph (1)) does not result in average
per gallon emissions (measured on a mass basis) of (i)
volatile organic compounds, (ii) oxides of nitrogen, (iii) car-
bon monoxide, and (iv) toxic air pollutants in excess of
such emissions of such pollutants attributable to gasoline
sold or introduced into commerce in calendar year 1990 by
that refiner, blender, or importer. Such regulations shall
take effect beginning January 1, 1995.
(B) ADJUSTMENTS.—In evaluating compliance with the
requirements of subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall
make appropriate adjustments to insure that no credit is
provided for improvement in motor vehicle emissions con-
trol in motor vehicles sold after the calendar year 1990.
(C) COMPLIANCE DETERMINED FOR EACH POLLUTANT
INDEPENDENTLY.—In determining whether there is an in-
crease in emissions in violation of the prohibition con-
tained in subparagraph (A) the Administrator shall con-
sider an increase in each air pollutant referred to in
clauses (i) through (iv) as a separate violation of such pro-
hibition, except that the Administrator shall promulgate
regulations to provide that any increase in emissions of ox-
ides of nitrogen resulting from adding oxygenates to gaso-
line may be offset by an equivalent or greater reduction
(on a mass basis) in emissions of volatile organic com-
pounds, carbon monoxide, or toxic air pollutants, or any
combination of the foregoing.
(D) COMPLIANCE PERIOD.—The Administrator shall
promulgate an appropriate compliance period or appro-

ance with the prohibition contained in subparagraph (A).
(E) BASELINE FOR DETERMINING COMPLIANCE.—If the
Administrator determines that no adequate and reliable
data exists regarding the composition of gasoline sold or
introduced into commerce by a refiner, blender, or im-
porter in calendar year 1990, for such refiner, blender, or
importer, baseline gasoline shall be substituted for such
1990 gasoline in determining compliance with subpara-
graph (A).
(9) EMISSIONS FROM ENTIRE VEHICLE.—In applying the re-
quirements of this subsection, the Administrator shall take
into account emissions from the entire motor vehicle, including
evaporative, running, refueling, and exhaust emissions.

carbon monoxide and which has a carbon monoxide design
value of 9.5 parts per million (ppm) or above based on data for
the 2-year period of 1988 and 1989 and calculated according to
the most recent interpretation methodology issued by the Ad-
ministrator prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 shall submit to the Administrator a State
implementation plan revision under section 110 and part D of
title I for such area which shall contain the provisions specified
under this subsection regarding oxygenated gasoline.
(B) A plan revision which contains such provisions shall
also be submitted by each State in which there is located any

Administrator, but shall not be less than 4 months. At the re-
quest of a State with respect to any area designated as non-
attainment for carbon monoxide, the Administrator may reduce
the period specified in the preceding sentence if the State can
demonstrate that because of meteorological conditions, a re-
duced period will assure that there will be no exceedances of
the carbon monoxide standard outside of such reduced period.
For areas with a carbon monoxide design value of 9.5 ppm or
more 126 of the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, the revision shall provide that such require-
ment shall take effect no later than November 1, 1992, (or at
such other date during 1992 as the Administrator establishes
under the preceding provisions of this paragraph). For other
areas, the revision shall provide that such requirement shall
take effect no later than November 1 of the third year after the
last year of the applicable 2-year period referred to in para-
graph (1) (or at such other date during such third year as the
Administrator establishes under the preceding provisions of
this paragraph) and shall include a program for implementa-
tion and enforcement of the requirement consistent with guid-
ance to be issued by the Administrator.
(3) WAIVERS.—(A) The Administrator shall waive, in whole
or in part, the requirements of paragraph (2) upon a dem-
onstration by the State to the satisfaction of the Administrator
that the use of oxygenated gasoline would prevent or interfere
with the attainment by the area of a national primary ambient
air quality standard (or a State or local ambient air quality
standard) for any air pollutant other than carbon monoxide.
(B) The Administrator shall, upon demonstration by the
State satisfactory to the Administrator, waive the requirement
of paragraph (2) where the Administrator determines that mo-
bile sources of carbon monoxide do not contribute significantly
to carbon monoxide levels in an area.
(C)(i) Any person may petition the Administrator to make
a finding that there is, or is likely to be, for any area, an inad-
equate domestic supply of, or distribution capacity for,
oxygenated gasoline meeting the requirements of paragraph (2)
or fuel additives (oxygenates) necessary to meet such require-
ments. The Administrator shall act on such petition within 6
months after receipt of the petition.
(ii) If the Administrator determines, in response to a peti-
tion under clause (i), that there is an inadequate supply or ca-
pacity described in clause (i), the Administrator shall delay the
effective date of paragraph (2) for 1 year. Upon petition, the
Administrator may extend such effective date for one addi-
tional year. No partial delay or lesser waiver may be granted
under this clause.
(iii) In granting waivers under this subparagraph the Ad-
ministrator shall consider distribution capacity separately from
the adequacy of domestic supply and shall grant such waivers
in such manner as will assure that, if supplies of oxygenated
gasoline are limited, areas having the highest design value for

carbon monoxide will have a priority in obtaining oxygenated
gasoline which meets the requirements of paragraph (2).
(iv) As used in this subparagraph, the term distribution
capacity includes capacity for transportation, storage, and
blending.
(4) FUEL DISPENSING SYSTEMS.—Any person selling
oxygenated gasoline at retail pursuant to this subsection shall
be required under regulations promulgated by the Adminis-
trator to label the fuel dispensing system with a notice that the
gasoline is oxygenated and will reduce the carbon monoxide
emissions from the motor vehicle.
(5) GUIDELINES FOR CREDIT.—The Administrator shall pro-
mulgate guidelines, within 9 months after the date of the en-
actment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, allowing
the use of marketable oxygen credits from gasolines during
that portion of the year specified in paragraph (2) with higher
oxygen content than required to offset the sale or use of gaso-
line with a lower oxygen content than required. No credits may
be transferred between nonattainment areas.
(6) ATTAINMENT AREAS.—Nothing in this subsection shall
be interpreted as requiring an oxygenated gasoline program in
an area which is in attainment for carbon monoxide, except
that in a carbon monoxide nonattainment area which is redes-
ignated as attainment for carbon monoxide, the requirements
of this subsection shall remain in effect to the extent such pro-
gram is necessary to maintain such standard thereafter in the
area.
(7) FAILURE TO ATTAIN CO STANDARD.—If the Administrator
determines under section 186(b)(2) that the national primary
ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide has not been
attained in a Serious Area by the applicable attainment date,
the State shall submit a plan revision for the area within 9
months after the date of such determination. The plan revision
shall provide that the minimum oxygen content of gasoline re-
ferred to in paragraph (2) shall be 3.1 percent by weight unless
such requirement is waived in accordance with the provisions
of this subsection.
(n) P ROHIBITION ON LEADED GASOLINE FOR HIGHWAY USE.—
After December 31, 1995, it shall be unlawful for any person to
sell, offer for sale, supply, offer for supply, dispense, transport, or
introduce into commerce, for use as fuel in any motor vehicle (as
defined in section 219(2)) 127 any gasoline which contains lead or
lead additives.
(o) RENEWABLE FUEL PROGRAM.—
(1) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:

(i) IN GENERAL.—Not later than November 30 of
each of calendar years 2005 through 2021, based on
the estimate provided under subparagraph (A), the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
shall determine and publish in the Federal Register,
with respect to the following calendar year, the renew-
able fuel obligation that ensures that the requirements
of paragraph (2) are met.
(ii) REQUIRED ELEMENTS.—The renewable fuel ob-
ligation determined for a calendar year under clause
(i) shall—
(I) be applicable to refineries, blenders, and
importers, as appropriate;
(II) be expressed in terms of a volume per-
centage of transportation fuel sold or introduced

in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions specified in para-
graphs (2)(A)(i) (relating to renewable fuel), (1)(D) (relating
to biomass-based diesel), (1)(B)(i) (relating to advanced
biofuel), and (1)(E) (relating to cellulosic biofuel) to a lower
percentage. For the 50 and 60 percent reductions, the Ad-
ministrator may make such an adjustment only if he de-
termines that generally such reduction is not commercially
feasible for fuels made using a variety of feedstocks, tech-
nologies, and processes to meet the applicable reduction.

justed greenhouse gas reduction shall be established by
the Administrator at the maximum achievable level, tak-
ing cost in consideration, for natural gas fired corn-based
ethanol plants, allowing for the use of a variety of tech-
nologies and processes. An adjustment in the 50 or 60 per-
cent greenhouse gas levels shall be the minimum possible
adjustment for the fuel or fuels concerned, and the ad-
justed greenhouse gas reduction shall be established at the
maximum achievable level, taking cost in consideration, al-
lowing for the use of a variety of feedstocks, technologies,
and processes.
(D) 5-YEAR REVIEW.—Whenever the Administrator
makes any adjustment under this paragraph, not later
than 5 years thereafter he shall review and revise (based
upon the same criteria and standards as required for the
initial adjustment) the regulations establishing the ad-
justed level.

trator has promulgated a final rule under the last sentence
of paragraph (2)(A)(i) with respect to the method of deter-
mining lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, except as pro-
vided in subparagraph (D), the Administrator may not ad-
just the percent greenhouse gas reduction levels unless he
determines that there has been a significant change in the
analytical methodology used for determining the lifecycle
greenhouse gas emissions. If he makes such determination,
he may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent reduction levels
through rulemaking using the criteria and standards set
forth in this paragraph.
(F) LIMIT ON UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS.—If, under sub-
paragraph (D) or (E), the Administrator revises a percent
level adjusted as provided in subparagraphs (A), (B), and
(C) to a higher percent, such higher percent may not ex-
ceed the applicable percent specified in paragraph (2)(A)(i),
(1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or (1)(E).
(G) APPLICABILITY OF ADJUSTMENTS.—If the Adminis-
trator adjusts, or revises, a percent level referred to in this
paragraph or makes a change in the analytical method-
ology used for determining the lifecycle greenhouse gas
emissions, such adjustment, revision, or change (or any
combination thereof) shall only apply to renewable fuel
from new facilities that commence construction after the
effective date of such adjustment, revision, or change.

307 Sec. 211CLEAN AIR ACT
(D) CELLULOSIC BIOFUEL.—(i) For any calendar year
for which the projected volume of cellulosic biofuel produc-
tion is less than the minimum applicable volume estab-
lished under paragraph (2)(B), as determined by the Ad-
ministrator based on the estimate provided under para-
graph (3)(A), not later than November 30 of the preceding
calendar year, the Administrator shall reduce the applica-
ble volume of cellulosic biofuel required under paragraph
(2)(B) to the projected volume available during that cal-
endar year. For any calendar year in which the Adminis-
trator makes such a reduction, the Administrator may also
reduce the applicable volume of renewable fuel and ad-
vanced biofuels requirement established under paragraph
(2)(B) by the same or a lesser volume.
(ii) Whenever the Administrator reduces the minimum
cellulosic biofuel volume under this subparagraph, the Ad-
ministrator shall make available for sale cellulosic biofuel
credits at the higher of $0.25 per gallon or the amount by
which $3.00 per gallon exceeds the average wholesale price
of a gallon of gasoline in the United States. Such amounts
shall be adjusted for inflation by the Administrator for
years after 2008.
(iii) Eighteen months after the date of enactment of
this subparagraph, the Administrator shall promulgate
regulations to govern the issuance of credits under this
subparagraph. The regulations shall set forth the method
for determining the exact price of credits in the event of
a waiver. The price of such credits shall not be changed
more frequently than once each quarter. These regulations
shall include such provisions, including limiting the cred-
its’ uses and useful life, as the Administrator deems appro-
priate to assist market liquidity and transparency, to pro-
vide appropriate certainty for regulated entities and re-
newable fuel producers, and to limit any potential misuse
of cellulosic biofuel credits to reduce the use of other re-
newable fuels, and for such other purposes as the Adminis-
trator determines will help achieve the goals of this sub-
section. The regulations shall limit the number of cellu-
losic biofuel credits for any calendar year to the minimum
applicable volume (as reduced under this subparagraph) of
cellulosic biofuel for that year.
(E) BIOMASS-BASED DIESEL.—

riod, the quantity of biomass-based diesel required
under subparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity
that does not exceed 15 percent of the applicable an-
nual requirement for biomass-based diesel. For any
calendar year in which the Administrator makes a re-
duction under this subparagraph, the Administrator
may also reduce the applicable volume of renewable
fuel and advanced biofuels requirement established
under paragraph (2)(B) by the same or a lesser vol-
ume.
(iii) EXTENSIONS.—If the Administrator deter-
mines that the feedstock disruption or circumstances
described in clause (ii) is continuing beyond the 60-day
period described in clause (ii) or this clause, the Ad-
ministrator, in consultation with the Secretary of En-
ergy and the Secretary of Agriculture, may issue an
order to reduce, for up to an additional 60-day period,
the quantity of biomass-based diesel required under
subparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity that
does not exceed an additional 15 percent of the appli-
cable annual requirement for biomass-based diesel.
(F) MODIFICATION OF APPLICABLE VOLUMES.—For any
of the tables in paragraph (2)(B), if the Administrator
waives—(i) at least 20 percent of the applicable volume re-
quirement set forth in any such table for 2 consecutive
years; or
(ii) at least 50 percent of such volume requirement
for a single year,
the Administrator shall promulgate a rule (within 1 year
after issuing such waiver) that modifies the applicable vol-
umes set forth in the table concerned for all years fol-
lowing the final year to which the waiver applies, except
that no such modification in applicable volumes shall be
made for any year before 2016. In promulgating such a
rule, the Administrator shall comply with the processes,
criteria, and standards set forth in paragraph (2)(B)(ii).

(a) EMISSIONS STANDARDS.—(1) The Administrator shall con-
duct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and nonroad vehi-
cles (other than locomotives or engines used in locomotives) to de-
termine if such emissions cause, or significantly contribute to, air
pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public
health or welfare. Such study shall be completed within 12 months
of the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990.
(2) After notice and opportunity for public hearing, the Admin-
istrator shall determine within 12 months after completion of the
study under paragraph (1), based upon the results of such study,

whether emissions of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and
volatile organic compounds from new and existing nonroad engines
or nonroad vehicles (other than locomotives or engines used in loco-
motives) are significant contributors to ozone or carbon monoxide
concentrations in more than 1 area which has failed to attain the
national ambient air quality standards for ozone or carbon mon-
oxide. Such determination shall be included in the regulations
under paragraph (3).
(3) If the Administrator makes an affirmative determination
under paragraph (2) the Administrator shall, within 12 months
after completion of the study under paragraph (1), promulgate (and
from time to time revise) regulations containing standards applica-
ble to emissions from those classes or categories of new nonroad en-
gines and new nonroad vehicles (other than locomotives or engines
used in locomotives) which in the Administrator’s judgment cause,
or contribute to, such air pollution. Such standards shall achieve
the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the
application of technology which the Administrator determines will
be available for the engines or vehicles to which such standards
apply, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of applying such
technology within the period of time available to manufacturers
and to noise, energy, and safety factors associated with the applica-
tion of such technology. In determining what degree of reduction
will be available, the Administrator shall first consider standards
equivalent in stringency to standards for comparable motor vehi-
cles or engines (if any) regulated under section 202, taking into ac-
count the technological feasibility, costs, safety, noise, and energy
factors associated with achieving, as appropriate, standards of such
stringency and lead time. The regulations shall apply to the useful
life of the engines or vehicles (as determined by the Administrator).
(4) If the Administrator determines that any emissions not re-
ferred to in paragraph (2) from new nonroad engines or vehicles
significantly contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be
anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, the Administrator
may promulgate (and from time to time revise) such regulations as
the Administrator deems appropriate containing standards applica-
ble to emissions from those classes or categories of new nonroad en-
gines and new nonroad vehicles (other than locomotives or engines
used in locomotives) which in the Administrator’s judgment cause,
or contribute to, such air pollution, taking into account costs, noise,
safety, and energy factors associated with the application of tech-
nology which the Administrator determines will be available for the
engines and vehicles to which such standards apply. The regula-
tions shall apply to the useful life of the engines or vehicles (as de-
termined by the Administrator).
(5) Within 5 years after the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall promulgate regula-
tions containing standards applicable to emissions from new loco-
motives and new engines used in locomotives. Such standards shall
achieve the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable
through the application of technology which the Administrator de-
termines will be available for the locomotives or engines to which
such standards apply, giving appropriate consideration to the cost
of applying such technology within the period of time available to

with the application of such technology.
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Standards under this section shall take
effect at the earliest possible date considering the lead time nec-
essary to permit the development and application of the requisite
technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compli-
ance within such period and energy and safety.
(c) S AFE CONTROLS.—Effective with respect to new engines or
vehicles to which standards under this section apply, no emission
control device, system, or element of design shall be used in such
a new nonroad engine or new nonroad vehicle for purposes of com-
plying with such standards if such device, system, or element of de-
sign will cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public
health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function. In deter-
mining whether an unreasonable risk exists, the Administrator
shall consider factors including those described in section
202(a)(4)(B).
(d) ENFORCEMENT.—The standards under this section shall be
subject to sections 206, 207, 208, and 209, with such modifications
of the applicable regulations implementing such sections as the Ad-
ministrator deems appropriate, and shall be enforced in the same
manner as standards prescribed under section 202. The Adminis-
trator shall revise or promulgate regulations as may be necessary
to determine compliance with, and enforce, standards in effect
under this section.

facturer under subsection (b) and approved by the Administrator.
(2) If the Administrator finds that adjustments or modifica-
tions made pursuant to instructions of the manufacturer under
paragraph (1) will not insure emission control performance with re-
spect to each standard under section 202 at least equivalent to that
which would result if no such adjustments or modifications were
made, he shall disapprove such instructions. Such findings shall be
based upon minimum engineering evaluations consistent with good
engineering practice.
(b)(1) Instructions respecting each class or category of vehicles
or engines to which this title applies providing for such vehicle and
engine adjustments and modifications as may be necessary to in-
sure emission control performance at different altitudes shall be
submitted by the manufacturer to the Administrator pursuant to
regulations promulgated by the Administrator.

lation by such manufacturer of section 203(a)(3) for purposes of the
penalties contained in section 205.
(3) Such instruction shall provide, in addition to other adjust-
ments, for adjustments for vehicles moving from high altitude
areas to low altitude areas after the initial registration of such ve-
hicles.
(c) No instructions under this section respecting adjustments
or modifications may require the use of any manufacturer parts (as
defined in section 203(a)) unless the manufacturer demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the Administrator that the use of such manufac-
turer parts is necessary to insure emission control performance.
(d) Before January 1, 1981 the authority provided by this sec-
tion shall be available in any high altitude State (as determined
under regulations of the Administrator under regulations promul-
gated before the date of the enactment of this Act) but after De-
cember 31, 1980, such authority shall be available only in any such
State in which an inspection and maintenance program for the
testing of motor vehicle emissions has been instituted for the por-
tions of the State where any national ambient air quality standard
for auto-related pollutants has not been attained.
(e) HIGH ALTITUDE TESTING.—(1) The Administrator shall
promptly establish at least one testing center (in addition to the
testing centers existing on the date of the enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990) located at a site that represents high
altitude conditions, to ascertain in a reasonable manner whether,
when in actual use throughout their useful life (as determined
under section 202(d)), each class or category of vehicle and engines
to which regulations under section 202 apply conforms to the emis-
sions standards established by such regulations. For purposes of
this subsection, the term ‘‘high altitude conditions’’ refers to high
altitude as defined in regulations of the Administrator in effect as

to part A under section 216 shall also apply for purposes of
this part.
(2) CLEAN ALTERNATIVE FUEL.—The term ‘‘clean alter-
native fuel’’ means any fuel (including methanol, ethanol, or
other alcohols (including any mixture thereof containing 85
percent or more by volume of such alcohol with gasoline or
other fuels), reformulated gasoline, diesel, natural gas, lique-
fied petroleum gas, and hydrogen) or power source (including
electricity) used in a clean-fuel vehicle that complies with the
standards and requirements applicable to such vehicle under
this title when using such fuel or power source. In the case of
any flexible fuel vehicle or dual fuel vehicle, the term ‘‘clean
alternative fuel’’ means only a fuel with respect to which such
vehicle was certified as a clean-fuel vehicle meeting the stand-

or fewer carbon atoms. To demonstrate compliance with a
NMOG standard, NMOG emissions shall be measured in ac-
cordance with the ‘‘California Non-Methane Organic Gas Test
Procedures’’. In the case of vehicles using fuels other than base
gasoline, the level of NMOG emissions shall be adjusted based
on the reactivity of the emissions relative to vehicles using
base gasoline.

(1) SINGLE SET OF CARB STANDARDS.—If the State of Cali-
fornia promulgates regulations establishing and implementing
a single set of standards applicable in California pursuant to
a waiver approved under section 209 to any category of vehi-
cles referred to in subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
and such set of standards is, in the aggregate, at least as pro-
tective of public health and welfare as the otherwise applicable
standards set forth in section 242 and subsection (a), (b), (c),
or (d) of this section, such set of California standards shall
apply to clean-fuel vehicles in such category in lieu of the
standards otherwise applicable under section 242 and sub-
section (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section, as the case may be.
(2) MULTIPLE SETS OF CARB STANDARDS.—If the State of
California promulgates regulations establishing and imple-
menting several different sets of standards applicable in Cali-
fornia pursuant to a waiver approved under section 209 to any
category of vehicles referred to in subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d)
of this section and each of such sets of California standards is,
in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and
welfare as the otherwise applicable standards set forth in sec-
tion 242 and subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section, such
standards shall be treated as ‘‘qualifying California standards’’
for purposes of this paragraph. Where more than one set of
qualifying standards are established and administered by the
State of California, the least stringent set of qualifying Cali-
fornia standards shall apply to the clean-fuel vehicles con-
cerned in lieu of the standards otherwise applicable to such ve-
hicles under section 242 and this section.
(f) LESS STRINGENT CARB STANDARDS.—If the Low-Emission
Vehicle and Clean Fuels Regulations of the California Air Re-
sources Board applicable to any category of vehicles referred to in
subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section are modified after the
enactment of the Clean Air Act of 1990 to provide an emissions
standard which is less stringent than the otherwise applicable
standard set forth in subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), or if any effec-
tive date contained in such regulations is delayed, such modified
standards or such delay (or both, as the case may be) shall apply,
for an interim period, in lieu of the standard or effective date other-
wise applicable under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) to any vehicles
covered by such modified standard or delayed effective date. The
interim period shall be a period of not more than 2 model years
from the effective date otherwise applicable under subsection (a),
(b), (c), or (d). After such interim period, the otherwise applicable
standard set forth in subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) shall take effect
with respect to such vehicles (unless subsequently replaced under
subsection (e)).
(g) NOT APPLICABLE TO HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES.—Notwith-
standing any provision of the Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean
Fuels Regulations of the California Air Resources Board nothing in
this section shall apply to heavy-duty engines in vehicles of more
than 8,500 lbs. GVWR.

Where the numerical clean-fuel vehicle standards applicable
under this part to vehicles of not more than 8,500 lbs. GVWR are
the same as numerical emission standards applicable in California
under the Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels Regulations of
the California Air Resources Board (‘‘CARB’’), such standards shall
be administered and enforced by the Administrator—
(1) in the same manner and with the same flexibility as
the State of California administers and enforces corresponding
standards applicable under the Low-Emission Vehicle and
Clean Fuels Regulations of the California Air Resources Board
(‘‘CARB’’); and
(2) subject to the same requirements, and utilizing the
same interpretations and policy judgments, as are applicable in
the case of such CARB standards, including, but not limited to,
requirements regarding certification, production-line testing,
and in-use compliance,
unless the Administrator determines (in promulgating the rules es-
tablishing the clean fuel vehicle program under this section) that
any such administration and enforcement would not meet the cri-
teria for a waiver under section 209. Nothing in this section shall
apply in the case of standards under section 245 for heavy-duty ve-
hicles.

gines manufactured for the model year 1998 or thereafter and hav-
ing a GVWR greater than 8,500 lbs. and up to 26,000 lbs. GVWR,
the standards under this part for clean-fuel vehicles shall require
that combined emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and non-
methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) shall not exceed 3.15 grams per
brake horsepower hour (equivalent to 50 percent of the combined
emission standards applicable under section 202 for such air pollut-
ants in the case of a conventional model year 1994 heavy-duty die-
sel-fueled vehicle or engine). No standard shall be promulgated as
provided in this section for any heavy-duty vehicle of more than
26,000 lbs. GVWR.
(b) R EVISED STANDARDS THAT ARE LESS STRINGENT.—(1) The
Administrator may promulgate a revised less stringent standard
for the vehicles or engines referred to in subsection (a) if the Ad-
ministrator determines that the 50 percent reduction required
under subsection (a) is not technologically feasible for clean diesel-
fueled vehicles and engines, taking into account durability, costs,
lead time, safety, and other relevant factors. To provide adequate
lead time the Administrator shall make a determination with re-

ficient clean alternative fuels shall be produced, distributed
and made available to assure that all clean-fuel vehicles re-
quired under this section can operate, to the maximum extent
practicable, exclusively on such fuels in California. The State
shall require that clean alternative fuels be made available
and offered for sale at an adequate number of locations with
sufficient geographic distribution to ensure convenient refuel-
ing with clean alternative fuels, considering the number of,
and type of, such vehicles sold and the geographic distribution
of such vehicles within the State. The State shall determine
the clean alternative fuels to be produced, distributed, and
made available based on motor vehicle manufacturers’ projec-
tions of future sales of such vehicles and consultations with the
affected local governments and fuel suppliers.
(B) The State may by regulation grant persons subject to
the requirements prescribed under this paragraph an appro-
priate amount of credits for exceeding such requirements, and
any person granted credits may transfer some or all of the
credits for use by one or more persons in demonstrating com-
pliance with such requirements. The State may make the cred-
its available for use after consideration of enforceability, envi-
ronmental, and economic factors and upon such terms and con-
ditions as the State finds appropriate.
(C) The State may also by regulation establish specifica-
tions for any clean alternative fuel produced and made avail-
able under this paragraph as the State finds necessary to re-
duce or eliminate an unreasonable risk to public health, wel-
fare, or safety associated with its use or to ensure acceptable
vehicle maintenance and performance characteristics.
(D) If a retail gasoline dispensing facility would have to re-
move or replace one or more motor vehicle fuel underground
storage tanks and accompanying piping in order to comply
with the provisions of this section, and it had removed and re-
placed such tank or tanks and accompanying piping in order
to comply with subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act prior
to the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, it shall not be required to comply with this subsection
until a period of 7 years has passed from the date of the re-
moval and replacement of such tank or tanks.
(E) Nothing in this section authorizes any State other than
California to adopt provisions regarding clean alternative fuels.
(F) If the State of California fails to adopt a clean fuel pro-
gram that meets the requirements of this paragraph, the Ad-
ministrator shall, within 4 years after the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, establish a clean fuel pro-
gram for the State of California under this paragraph and sec-
tion 110(c) that meets the requirements of this paragraph.
(d) CREDITS FOR MOTOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS.—(1) The

(B) The sale of clean 148 fuel vehicles which meet standards
established by the Administrator as provided in paragraph (3)
which are more stringent than the clean-fuel vehicle standards
otherwise applicable to such clean-fuel vehicle. A manufacturer
granted credits under this paragraph may transfer some or all
of the credits for use by one or more other manufacturers in
demonstrating compliance with the requirements prescribed
under this paragraph. The Administrator may make the cred-
its available for use after consideration of enforceability, envi-
ronmental, and economic factors and upon such terms and con-
ditions as he finds appropriate. The Administrator shall grant
credits in accordance with this paragraph, notwithstanding any
requirements of State law or any credits granted with respect
to the same vehicles under any State law, rule, or regulation.
(2) REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION.—The Administrator
shall administer the credit program established under this sub-
section. Within 12 months after the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall promulgate regula-
tions for such credit program.

duced, sold, and distributed in the State of California
under this section, and
(B) clean alternative fuels required to be produced and
distributed under this section by fuel suppliers and made
available in California 151
may also be sold and used in other States which submit plan
revisions under paragraph (2).
(2) PLAN REVISIONS.—Any State in which there is located
all or part of an ozone nonattainment area classified under
subpart D of title I as Serious, Severe, or Extreme may submit
a revision of the applicable implementation plan under part D
of title I and section 110 to provide incentives for the sale or
use in such an area or State of clean-fuel vehicles which are
required to be produced, sold, and distributed in the State of
California, and for the use in such an area or State of clean
alternative fuels required to be produced and distributed by
fuel suppliers and made available in California. Such plan pro-
visions shall not take effect until 1 year after the State has
provided notice of such provisions to motor vehicle manufactur-
ers and to fuel suppliers.
(3) INCENTIVES.—The incentives referred to in paragraph
(2) may include any or all of the following:
(A) A State registration fee on new motor vehicles reg-
istered in the State which are not clean-fuel vehicles in the
amount of at least 1 percent of the cost of the vehicle. The
proceeds of such fee shall be used to provide financial in-
centives to purchasers of clean-fuel vehicles and to vehicle
dealers who sell high volumes or high percentages of
clean-fuel vehicles and to defray the administrative costs
of the incentive program.
(B) Provisions to exempt clean-fuel vehicles from high
occupancy vehicle or trip reduction requirements.
(C) Provisions to provide preference in the use of exist-
ing parking spaces for clean-fuel vehicles.
The incentives under this paragraph shall not apply in the
case of covered fleet vehicles.
(4) NO SALES OR PRODUCTION MANDATE.—The regulations
and plan revisions under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not in-
clude any production or sales mandate for clean-fuel vehicles

administratively infeasible, the Administrator may provide, by reg-
ulation, other means by which the Administrator will directly ad-
minister such provisions so as to achieve the appropriate purpose.
(5) Until such time as the Administrator promulgates regula-
tions pursuant to this subsection, the Administrator may continue

113(c) for the procurement of goods, materials, and services to per-
form such contract at any facility at which the violation which gave
rise to such conviction occurred if such facility is owned, leased, or
supervised by such person. The prohibition in the preceding sen-
tence shall continue until the Administrator certifies that the con-
dition giving rise to such a conviction has been corrected. For con-
victions arising under section 113(c)(2), the condition giving rise to
the conviction also shall be considered to include any substantive
violation of this Act associated with the violation of 113(c)(2). The
Administrator may extend this prohibition to other facilities owned

the Administrator may issue subpenas for the attendance and testi-
mony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books,
and documents, and he may administer oaths. Except for emission
data, upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator by such
owner or operator that such papers, books, documents, or informa-
tion or particular part thereof, if made public, would divulge trade
secrets or secret processes of such owner or operator, the Adminis-
trator shall consider such record, report, or information or par-
ticular portion thereof confidential in accordance with the purposes
of section 1905 of title 18 of the United States Code, except that
such paper, book, document, or information may be discussed to

rying out the National Academy of Sciences’ study and investiga-
tion provided for in section 202(c), or when relevant in any pro-
ceeding under this Act. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the
same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the

served upon any person under this subparagraph, the district court
of the United States for any district in which such person is found
or resides or transacts business, upon application by the United
States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to

programs under section 114(a)(3) of this Act, or any other final ac-
tion of the Administrator under this Act (including any denial or
disapproval by the Administrator under title I) which is local or re-
gionally applicable may be filed only in the United States Court of
Appeals for the appropriate circuit. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence a petition for review of any action referred to in such sen-
tence may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia if such action is based on a determination
of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the Ad-
ministrator finds and publishes that such action is based on such
a determination. Any petition for review under this subsection
shall be filed within sixty days from the date notice of such promul-
gation, approval, or action appears in the Federal Register, except
that if such petition is based solely on grounds arising after such
sixtieth day, then any petition for review under this subsection
shall be filed within sixty days after such grounds arise. The filing
of a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of any other-
wise final rule or action shall not affect the finality of such rule or
action for purposes of judicial review nor extend the time within
which a petition for judicial review of such rule or action under this
section may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of
such rule or action.
(2) Action of the Administrator with respect to which review
could have been obtained under paragraph (1) shall not be subject
to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.
Where a final decision by the Administrator defers performance of
any nondiscretionary statutory action to a later time, any person
may challenge the deferral pursuant to paragraph (1).

for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfac-
tion of the court that such additional evidence is material and that
there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evi-
dence in the proceeding before the Administrator, the court may
order such additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to
be taken before the Administrator, in such manner and upon such
terms and conditions as to 164 the court may deem proper. The Ad-
ministrator may modify his findings as to the facts, or make new
findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken and he shall
file such modified or new findings, and his recommendation, if any,
for the modification or setting aside of his original determination,

differs in any important respect from any of these recommenda-
tions, an explanation of the reasons for such differences. All data,
information, and documents referred to in this paragraph on which
the proposed rule relies shall be included in the docket on the date
of publication of the proposed rule.
(4)(A) The rulemaking docket required under paragraph (2)
shall be open for inspection by the public at reasonable times speci-
fied in the notice of proposed rulemaking. Any person may copy
documents contained in the docket. The Administrator shall pro-
vide copying facilities which may be used at the expense of the per-
son seeking copies, but the Administrator may waive or reduce
such expenses in such instances as the public interest requires.
Any person may request copies by mail if the person pays the ex-
penses, including personnel costs to do the copying.
(B)(i) Promptly upon receipt by the agency, all written com-
ments and documentary information on the proposed rule received
from any person for inclusion in the docket during the comment pe-
riod shall be placed in the docket. The transcript of public hear-
ings, if any, on the proposed rule shall also be included in the dock-
et promptly upon receipt from the person who transcribed such
hearings. All documents which become available after the proposed
rule has been published and which the Administrator determines
are of central relevance to the rulemaking shall be placed in the
docket as soon as possible after their availability.
(ii) The drafts of proposed rules submitted by the Adminis-
trator to the Office of Management and Budget for any interagency
review process prior to proposal of any such rule, all documents ac-
companying such drafts, and all written comments thereon by
other agencies and all written responses to such written comments
by the Administrator shall be placed in the docket no later than
the date of proposal of the rule. The drafts of the final rule sub-
mitted for such review process prior to promulgation and all such
written comments thereon, all documents accompanying such
drafts, and written responses thereto shall be placed in the docket
no later than the date of promulgation.

data submitted in written or oral presentations during the com-
ment period.
(C) The promulgated rule may not be based (in part or whole)
on any information or data which has not been placed in the docket
as of the date of such promulgation.
(7)(A) The record for judicial review shall consist exclusively of
the material referred to in paragraph (3), clause (i) of paragraph
(4)(B), and subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (6).
(B) Only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised
with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment
(including any public hearing) may be raised during judicial re-
view. If the person raising an objection can demonstrate to the Ad-
ministrator that it was impracticable to raise such objection within
such time or if the grounds for such objection arose after the period
for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial re-
view) and if such objection is of central relevance to the outcome
of the rule, the Administrator shall convene a proceeding for recon-
sideration of the rule and provide the same procedural rights as
would have been afforded had the information been available at the
time the rule was proposed. If the Administrator refuses to convene
such a proceeding, such person may seek review of such refusal in
the United States court of appeals for the appropriate circuit (as
provided in subsection (b)). Such reconsideration shall not postpone
the effectiveness of the rule. The effectiveness of the rule may be
stayed during such reconsideration, however, by the Administrator
or the court for a period not to exceed three months.
(8) The sole forum for challenging procedural determinations
made by the Administrator under this subsection shall be in the
United States court of appeals for the appropriate circuit (as pro-
vided in subsection (b)) at the time of the substantive review of the
rule. No interlocutory appeals shall be permitted with respect to
such procedural determinations. In reviewing alleged procedural
errors, the court may invalidate the rule only if the errors were so
serious and related to matters of such central relevance to the rule
that there is a substantial likelihood that the rule would have been
significantly changed if such errors had not been made.
(9) In the case of review of any action of the Administrator to
which this subsection applies, the court may reverse any such ac-
tion found to be—
(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other-
wise not in accordance with law;
(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or im-
munity;
(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limita-

cious, (ii) the requirement of paragraph (7)(B) has been met,

review of regulation or orders of the Administrator under this Act,

witness fees) whenever it determines that such award is appro-

MANDATORY LICENSING
SEC. 308. Whenever the Attorney General determines upon ap-
plication of the Administrator—
(1) that—
(A) in the implementation of the requirements of sec-
tion 111, 112, or 202 of this Act, a right under any United
States letters patent, which is being used or intended for
public or commercial use and not otherwise reasonably
available, is necessary to enable any person required to
comply with such limitation to so comply, and
(B) there are no reasonable alternative methods to ac-
complish such purpose, and
(2) that the unavailability of such right may result in a
substantial lessening of competition or tendency to create a
monopoly in any line of commerce in any section of the coun-
try,
the Attorney General may so certify to a district court of the
United States, which may issue an order requiring the person who
owns such patent to license it on such reasonable terms and condi-
tions as the court, after hearing, may determine. Such certification
may be made to the district court for the district in which the per-
son owning the patent resides, does business, or is found.

Compliance Analysis (as established under subsection (f) of this
section), shall conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of
this Act on the public health, economy, and environment of the
United States. In performing such analysis, the Administrator
should consider the costs, benefits and other effects associated with
compliance with each standard issued for—
(1) a criteria air pollutant subject to a standard issued
under section 109;
(2) a hazardous air pollutant listed under section 112, in-
cluding any technology-based standard and any risk-based
standard for such pollutant;

public health, and environmental benefits of efforts to comply with
such standard. In any case where numerical values are assigned to
such benefits, a default assumption of zero value shall not be as-
signed to such benefits unless supported by specific data. The Ad-
ministrator shall assess how benefits are measured in order to as-
sure that damage to human health and the environment is more
accurately measured and taken into account.
(c) In describing the costs of a standard described in subsection
(a), the Administrator shall consider the effects of such standard on
employment, productivity, cost of living, economic growth, and the
overall economy of the United States.

the notice of proposed rulemaking in connection with such standard
or regulation is published in the Federal Register after the date
ninety days after the date of enactment of this section. In the case
of revisions of such standards or regulations, this section shall
apply only to revisions which the Administrator determines to be
substantial revisions.
(b) Before publication of notice of proposed rulemaking with re-
spect to any standard or regulation to which this section applies,
the Administrator shall prepare an economic impact assessment re-
specting such standard or regulation. Such assessment shall be in-
cluded in the docket required under section 307(d)(2) and shall be
available to the public as provided in section 307(d)(4). Notice of
proposed rulemaking shall include notice of such availability to-
gether with an explanation of the extent and manner in which the
Administrator has considered the analysis contained in such eco-
nomic impact assessment in proposing the action. The Adminis-
trator shall also provide such an explanation in his notice of pro-
mulgation of any regulation or standard referred to in subsection
(a). Each such explanation shall be part of the statements of basis
and purpose required under sections 307(d)(3) and 307(d)(6).
(c) Subject to subsection (d), the assessment required under

forcement of the Administrator’s duty under this section shall be
by bringing a citizen suit under such section 304(a)(2) for a court
order to compel the Administrator to perform such duty. Violation
of any such order shall subject the Administrator to penalties for
contempt of court.
(g) In the case of any provision of this Act in which costs are
expressly required to be taken into account, the adequacy or inad-
equacy of any assessment required under this section may be taken
into consideration, but shall not be treated for purposes of judicial
review of any such provision as conclusive with respect to compli-
ance or noncompliance with the requirement of such provision to

(iv) the principle that each State must take nec-
essary measures to safeguard public health regardless
of the source of the air pollution; and
(v) the principle that air quality data should be
carefully screened to ensure that events not likely to
recur are represented accurately in all monitoring
data and analyses.
(B) REQUIREMENTS.—Regulations promulgated under
this section shall, at a minimum, provide that—
(i) the occurrence of an exceptional event must be
demonstrated by reliable, accurate data that is
promptly produced and provided by Federal, State, or
local government agencies;
(ii) a clear causal relationship must exist between
the measured exceedances of a national ambient air
quality standard and the exceptional event to dem-
onstrate that the exceptional event caused a specific
air pollution concentration at a particular air quality
monitoring location;
(iii) there is a public process for determining
whether an event is exceptional; and
(iv) there are criteria and procedures for the Gov-
ernor of a State to petition the Administrator to ex-
clude air quality monitoring data that is directly due
to exceptional events from use in determinations by
the Administrator with respect to exceedances or vio-
lations of the national ambient air quality standards.
(4) I NTERIM PROVISION.—Until the effective date of a regu-
lation promulgated under paragraph (2), the following guid-
ance issued by the Administrator shall continue to apply:
(A) Guidance on the identification and use of air qual-
ity data affected by exceptional events (July 1986).
(B) Areas affected by PM–10 natural events, May 30,
1996.

uations of potential loss or shifts of employment which may result
from the administration or enforcement of the provision of this Act
and applicable implementation plans, including where appropriate,
investigating threatened plant closures or reductions in employ-
ment allegedly resulting from such administration or enforcement.
(b) Any employee, or any representative of such employee, who
is discharged or laid off, threatened with discharge or layoff, or
whose employment is otherwise adversely affected or threatened to
be adversely affected because of the alleged results of any require-
ment imposed or proposed to be imposed under this Act, including
any requirement applicable to Federal facilities and any require-
ment imposed by a State or political subdivision thereof, may re-
quest the Administrator to conduct a full investigation of the mat-
ter. Any such request shall be reduced to writing, shall set forth
with reasonable particularity the grounds for the request, and shall
be signed by the employee, or representative of such employee,
making the request. The Administrator shall thereupon investigate
the matter and, at the request of any party, shall hold public hear-
ings on not less than five days’ notice. At such hearings, the Ad-
ministrator shall require the parties, including the employer in-
volved, to present information relating to the actual or potential ef-
fect of such requirements on employment and the detailed reasons
or justification therefor. If the Administrator determines that there
are no reasonable grounds for conducting a public hearing he shall
notify (in writing) the party requesting such hearing of such a de-
termination and the reasons therefor. If the Administrator does
convene such a hearing, the hearing shall be on the record. Upon
receiving the report of such investigation, the Administrator shall
make findings of fact as to the effect of such requirements on em-
ployment and on the alleged actual or potential discharge, layoff,
or other adverse effect on employment, and shall make such rec-
ommendations as he deems appropriate. Such report, findings, and
recommendations shall be available to the public.

any requirement imposed under this Act or under any applica-
ble implementation plan,
(2) testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding,
or (3) assisted or participated or is about to assist or partici-
pate in any manner in such a proceeding or in any other action
to carry out the purposes of this Act.
(b)(1) Any employee who believes that he has been discharged
or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of
subsection (a) may, within thirty days after such violation occurs,
file (or have any person file on his behalf) a complaint with the
Secretary of Labor (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the
‘‘Secretary’’) alleging such discharge or discrimination. Upon receipt
of such a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person named
in the complaint of the filing of the complaint.

half) and the person alleged to have committed such violation of
the results of the investigation conducted pursuant to this subpara-
graph. Within ninety days of the receipt of such complaint the Sec-
retary shall, unless the proceeding on the complaint is terminated
by the Secretary on the basis of a settlement entered into by the
Secretary and the person alleged to have committed such violation,
issue an order either providing the relief prescribed by subpara-
graph (B) or denying the complaint. An order of the Secretary shall
be made on the record after notice and opportunity for public hear-
ing. The Secretary may not enter into a settlement terminating a
proceeding on a complaint without the participation and consent of
the complainant.
(B) If, in response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1), the
Secretary determines that a violation of subsection (a) has oc-
curred, the Secretary shall order the person who committed such
violation to (i) take affirmative action to abate the violation, and
(ii) reinstate the complainant to his former position together with
the compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions, and
privileges of his employment, and the Secretary may order such
person to provide compensatory damages to the complainant. If an
order is issued under this paragraph, the Secretary, at the request
of the complainant, shall assess against the person against whom
the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs
and expenses (including attorneys’ and expert witness fees) reason-
ably incurred, as determined by the Secretary, by the complainant
for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint upon which
the order was issued.
(c)(1) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order
issued under subsection (b) may obtain review of the order in the
United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation,
with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred. The
petition for review must be filed within sixty days from the
issuance of the Secretary’s order. Review shall conform to chapter
7 of title 5 of the United States Code. The commencement of pro-
ceedings under this subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the
court, operate as a stay of the Secretary’s order.
(2) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review
could have been obtained under paragraph (1) shall not be subject
to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.
(d) Whenever a person has failed to comply with an order
issued under subsection (b)(2), the Secretary may file a civil action
in the United States district court for the district in which the vio-
lation was found to occur to enforce such order. In actions brought
under this subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to
grant all appropriate relief including, but not limited to, injunctive
relief, compensatory, and exemplary damages.
(e)(1) Any person on whose behalf an order was issued under
paragraph (2) of subsection (b) may commence a civil action against
the person to whom such order was issued to require compliance
with such order. The appropriate United States district court shall
have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or
the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such order.

(c) For purposes of this section, an independent small business
marketer of gasoline is a person engaged in the marketing of gaso-
line who would be required to pay for procurement and installation
of vapor recovery equipment under section 324 173 of this Act or
under regulations of the Administrator, unless such person—
(1)(A) is a refiner, or
(B) controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with, a refiner.
(C) is otherwise directly or indirectly affiliated (as deter-
mined under the regulations of the Administrator) with a re-

the Interior and the Commandant of the United States Coast
Guard, the Administrator, by rule, shall establish requirements to
control air pollution from Outer Continental Shelf sources located
offshore of the States along the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic Coasts
(other than Outer Continental Shelf sources located offshore of the
North Slope Borough of the State of Alaska), and along the United
States Gulf Coast off the State of Florida eastward of longitude 87
degrees and 30 minutes (‘‘OCS sources’’) to attain and maintain
Federal and State ambient air quality standards and to comply
with the provisions of part C of title I. For such sources located
within 25 miles of the seaward boundary of such States, such re-
quirements shall be the same as would be applicable if the source
were located in the corresponding onshore area, and shall include,
but not be limited to, State and local requirements for emission
controls, emission limitations, offsets, permitting, monitoring, test-
ing, and reporting. New OCS sources shall comply with such re-
quirements on the date of promulgation and existing OCS sources
shall comply on the date 24 months thereafter. The Administrator
shall update such requirements as necessary to maintain consist-
ency with onshore regulations and this Act. The authority of this
subsection shall supersede section 5(a)(8) of the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act but shall not repeal or modify any other Federal,
State, or local authorities with respect to air quality. Each require-
ment established under this section shall be treated, for purposes
of sections 113, 114, 116, 120, and 304, as a standard under section
111 and a violation of any such requirement shall be considered a
violation of section 111(e).
(2) EXEMPTIONS.—The Administrator may exempt an OCS
source from a specific requirement in effect under regulations
under this subsection if the Administrator finds that compliance
with a pollution control technology requirement is technically infea-
sible or will cause an unreasonable threat to health and safety. The
Administrator shall make written findings explaining the basis of
any exemption issued pursuant to this subsection and shall impose
another requirement equal to or as close in stringency to the origi-
nal requirement as possible. The Administrator shall ensure that
any increase in emissions due to the granting of an exemption is
offset by reductions in actual emissions, not otherwise required by
this Act, from the same source or other sources in the area or in
the corresponding onshore area. The Administrator shall establish
procedures to provide for public notice and comment on exemptions
proposed pursuant to this subsection.
(3) STATE PROCEDURES.—Each State adjacent to an OCS
source included under this subsection may promulgate and submit
to the Administrator regulations for implementing and enforcing
the requirements of this subsection. If the Administrator finds that
the State regulations are adequate, the Administrator shall dele-
gate to that State any authority the Administrator has under this
Act to implement and enforce such requirements. Nothing in this
subsection shall prohibit the Administrator from enforcing any re-
quirement of this section.

(A) OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF.—The term ‘‘Outer Conti-
nental Shelf’’ has the meaning provided by section 2 of the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331).
(B) CORRESPONDING ONSHORE AREA.—The term ‘‘cor-
responding onshore area’’ means, with respect to any OCS
source, the onshore attainment or nonattainment area that is
closest to the source, unless the Administrator determines that
another area with more stringent requirements with respect to
the control and abatement of air pollution may reasonably be
expected to be affected by such emissions. Such determination
shall be based on the potential for air pollutants from the OCS
source to reach the other onshore area and the potential of
such air pollutants to affect the efforts of the other onshore
area to attain or maintain any Federal or State ambient air
quality standard or to comply with the provisions of part C of
title I.
(C) OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF SOURCE.—The terms
‘‘Outer Continental Shelf source’’ and ‘‘OCS source’’ include any
equipment, activity, or facility which—
(i) emits or has the potential to emit any air pollutant,
(ii) is regulated or authorized under the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf Lands Act, and
(iii) is located on the Outer Continental Shelf or in or
on waters above the Outer Continental Shelf.
Such activities include, but are not limited to, platform and
drill ship exploration, construction, development, production,
processing, and transportation. For purposes of this subsection,
emissions from any vessel servicing or associated with an OCS
source, including emissions while at the OCS source or en
route to or from the OCS source within 25 miles of the OCS
source, shall be considered direct emissions from the OCS
source.
(D) NEW AND EXISTING OCS SOURCES.—The term ‘‘new OCS
source’’ means an OCS source which is a new source within the
meaning of section 111(a). The term ‘‘existing OCS source’’
means any OCS source other than a new OCS source.
(b) REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER OFFSHORE AREAS.—For portions
of the United States Outer Continental Shelf that are adjacent to
the States not covered by subsection (a) which are Texas, Lou-
isiana, Mississippi, and Alabama or are adjacent to the North Slope
Borough of the State of Alaska, the Secretary shall consult with the
Administrator to assure coordination of air pollution control regula-
tion for Outer Continental Shelf emissions and emissions in adja-
cent onshore areas. Concurrently with this obligation, the Sec-
retary shall complete within 3 years of enactment of this section
a research study examining the impacts of emissions from Outer
Continental Shelf activities in such areas that fail to meet the na-
tional ambient air quality standards for either ozone or nitrogen di-
oxide. Based on the results of this study, the Secretary shall con-
sult with the Administrator and determine if any additional actions
are necessary. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums
as may be necessary to provide funding for the study required
under this section.

SEC. 401. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that—
(1) the presence of acidic compounds and their precursors
in the atmosphere and in deposition from the atmosphere rep-
resents a threat to natural resources, ecosystems, materials,
visibility, and public health;
(2) the principal sources of the acidic compounds and their
precursors in the atmosphere are emissions of sulfur and nitro-
gen oxides from the combustion of fossil fuels;
(3) the problem of acid deposition is of national and inter-
national significance;
(4) strategies and technologies for the control of precursors
to acid deposition exist now that are economically feasible, and
improved methods are expected to become increasingly avail-
able over the next decade;
(5) current and future generations of Americans will be ad-
versely affected by delaying measures to remedy the problem;
(6) reduction of total atmospheric loading of sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxides will enhance protection of the public
health and welfare and the environment; and
(7) control measures to reduce precursor emissions from
steam-electric generating units should be initiated without
delay.
(b) PURPOSES.—The purpose of this title is to reduce the ad-
verse effects of acid deposition through reductions in annual emis-
sions of sulfur dioxide of ten million tons from 1980 emission lev-
els, and, in combination with other provisions of this Act, of nitro-
gen oxides emissions of approximately two million tons from 1980
emission levels, in the forty-eight contiguous States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia. It is the intent of this title to effectuate such re-
ductions by requiring compliance by affected sources with pre-
scribed emission limitations by specified deadlines, which limita-
tions may be met through alternative methods of compliance pro-
vided by an emission allocation and transfer system. It is also the
purpose of this title to encourage energy conservation, use of re-
newable and clean alternative technologies, and pollution preven-
tion as a long-range strategy, consistent with the provisions of this
title, for reducing air pollution and other adverse impacts of energy
production and use.

tory, Version 2. The Administrator, in the Administrator’s
sole discretion, may exclude periods during which a unit is
shutdown for a continuous period of four calendar months
or longer, and make appropriate adjustments under this
paragraph. Upon petition of the owner or operator of any
unit, the Administrator may make appropriate baseline
adjustments for accidents that caused prolonged outages.

his own motion, by December 31, 1991, supplement data
needed in support of this title and correct any factual er-
rors in data from which affected Phase II units’ baselines
or actual 1985 emission rates have been calculated. Cor-
rected data shall be used for purposes of issuing allow-
ances under the 180 title. Such corrections shall not be sub-
ject to judicial review, nor shall the failure of the Adminis-
trator to correct an alleged factual error in such reports be
subject to judicial review.

ity unit for purposes of this title.
(C) A unit that cogenerates steam and electricity is not a
‘‘utility unit’’ for purposes of this title unless the unit is con-
structed for the purpose of supplying, or commences construc-
tion after the date of enactment of this title and supplies, more
than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and
more than 25 megawatts electrical output to any utility power
distribution system for sale.

SEC. 403. SULFUR DIOXIDE ALLOWANCE PROGRAM FOR EXISTING AND
NEW UNITS.
(a) ALLOCATIONS OF ANNUAL ALLOWANCES FOR EXISTING AND
NEW UNITS.—(1) 185 For the emission limitation programs under
this title, the Administrator shall allocate annual allowances for
the unit, to be held or distributed by the designated representative
of the owner or operator of each affected unit at an affected source
in accordance with this title, in an amount equal to the annual ton-
nage emission limitation calculated under section 404, 405, 406,
409, or 410 except as otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in
this title. Except as provided in sections 405(a)(2), 405(a)(3), 409
and 410, beginning January 1, 2000, the Administrator shall not
allocate annual allowances to emit sulfur dioxide pursuant to sec-
tion 405 in such an amount as would result in total annual emis-
sions of sulfur dioxide from utility units in excess of 8.90 million
tons except that the Administrator shall not take into account un-
used allowances carried forward by owners and operators of af-
fected units or by other persons holding such allowances, following
the year for which they were allocated. If necessary to meeting the
restrictions imposed in the preceding sentence, the Administrator
shall reduce, pro rata, the basic Phase II allowance allocations for
each unit subject to the requirements of section 405. Subject to the
provisions of section 416, the Administrator shall allocate allow-
ances for each affected unit at an affected source annually, as pro-
vided in paragraphs (2) and (3) 186 and section 408. Except as pro-
vided in sections 409 and 410, the removal of an existing affected
unit or source from commercial operation at any time after the date
of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (wheth-
er before or after January 1, 1995, or January 1, 2000) shall not
terminate or otherwise affect the allocation of allowances pursuant
to section 404 or 405 to which the unit is entitled. Allowances shall
be allocated by the Administrator without cost to the recipient, ex-
cept for allowances sold by the Administrator pursuant to section
416. Not later than December 31, 1991, the Administrator shall
publish a proposed list of the basic Phase II allowance allocations,

the Phase II bonus allowance allocations and, if applicable, alloca-
tions pursuant to section 405(a)(3) for each unit subject to the
emissions limitation requirements of section 405 for the year 2000
and the year 2010. After notice and opportunity for public com-
ment, but not later than December 31, 1992, the Administrator
shall publish a final list of such allocations, subject to the provi-
sions of section 405(a)(2). Any owner or operator of an existing unit
subject to the requirements of section 405(b) or (c) who is consid-
ering applying for an extension of the emission limitation require-
ment compliance deadline for that unit from January 1, 2000, until
not later than December 31, 2000, 187 pursuant to section 409, shall
notify the Administrator no later than March 31, 1991. Such notifi-
cation shall be used as the basis for estimating the basic Phase II
allowances under this subsection. Prior to June 1, 1998, the Admin-
istrator shall publish a revised final statement of allowance alloca-
tions, subject to the provisions of section 405(a)(2) and taking into
account the effect of any compliance date extensions granted pursu-
ant to section 409 on such allocations. Any person who may make
an election concerning the amount of allowances to be allocated to
a unit or units shall make such election and so inform the Adminis-
trator not later than March 31, 1991, in the case of an election
under section 405 (or June 30, 1991, in the case of an election
under section 406). If such person fails to make such election, the
Administrator shall set forth for each unit owned or operated by
such person, the amount of allowances reflecting the election that
would, in the judgment of the Administrator, provide the greatest
benefit for the owner or operator of the unit. If such person is a
Governor who may make an election under section 406 and the
Governor fails to make an election, the Administrator shall set
forth for each unit in the State the amount of allowances reflecting
the election that would, in the judgment of the Administrator, pro-
vide the greatest benefit for units in the State.
(b) ALLOWANCE TRANSFER SYSTEM.—Allowances allocated
under this title may be transferred among designated representa-
tives of the owners or operators of affected sources under this title
and any other person who holds such allowances, as provided by
the allowance system regulations to be promulgated by the Admin-
istrator not later than eighteen months after the date of enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Such regulations shall
establish the allowance system prescribed under this section, in-
cluding, but not limited to, requirements for the allocation, trans-
fer, and use of allowances under this title. Such regulations shall
prohibit the use of any allowance prior to the calendar year for
which the allowance was allocated, and shall provide, consistent
with the purposes of this title, for the identification of unused al-
lowances, and for such unused allowances to be carried forward
and added to allowances allocated in subsequent years, including
allowances allocated to units subject to Phase I requirements (as
described in section 404) which are applied to emissions limitations
requirements in Phase II (as described in section 405). Transfers
of allowances shall not be effective until written certification of the

transfer, signed by a responsible official of each party to the trans-
fer, is received and recorded by the Administrator. Such regula-
tions shall permit the transfer of allowances prior to the issuance
of such allowances. Recorded pre-allocation transfers shall be de-
ducted by the Administrator from the number of allowances which
would otherwise be allocated to the transferor, and added to those
allowances allocated to the transferee. Pre-allocation transfers
shall not affect the prohibition contained in this subsection against
the use of allowances prior to the year for which they are allocated.
(c) INTERPOLLUTANT TRADING.—Not later than January 1,
1994, the Administrator shall furnish to the Congress a study eval-
uating the environmental and economic consequences of amending
this title to permit trading sulfur dioxide allowances for nitrogen
oxides allowances.
(d) ALLOWANCE TRACKING SYSTEM.—(1) The Administrator
shall promulgate, not later than 18 months after the date of enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a system for
issuing, recording, and tracking allowances, which shall specify all
necessary procedures and requirements for an orderly and competi-
tive functioning of the allowance system. All allowance allocations
and transfers shall, upon recordation by the Administrator, be
deemed a part of each unit’s permit requirements pursuant to sec-
tion 408, without any further permit review and revision.
(2) In order to insure electric reliability, such regulations shall
not prohibit or affect temporary increases and decreases in emis-
sions within utility systems, power pools, or utilities entering into
allowance pool agreements, that result from their operations, in-
cluding emergencies and central dispatch, and such temporary
emissions increases and decreases shall not require transfer of al-
lowances among units nor shall it require recordation. The owners
or operators of such units shall act through a designated represent-
ative. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the total tonnage of
emissions in any calendar year (calculated at the end thereof) from
all units in such a utility system, power pool, or allowance pool
agreements shall not exceed the total allowances for such units for
the calendar year concerned.
(e) NEW UTILITY UNITS.—After January 1, 2000, it shall be un-
lawful for a new utility unit to emit an annual tonnage of sulfur
dioxide in excess of the number of allowances to emit held for the
unit by the unit’s owner or operator. Such new utility units shall
not be eligible for an allocation of sulfur dioxide allowances under
subsection (a)(1), unless the unit is subject to the provisions of sub-
section (g)(2) or (3) of section 405. New utility units may obtain al-
lowances from any person, in accordance with this title. The owner
or operator of any new utility unit in violation of this subsection
shall be liable for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 411
of this title.
(f) NATURE OF ALLOWANCES.—An allowance allocated under
this title is a limited authorization to emit sulfur dioxide in accord-
ance with the provisions of this title. Such allowance does not con-
stitute a property right. Nothing in this title or in any other provi-
sion of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the United
States to terminate or limit such authorization. Nothing in this sec-
tion relating to allowances shall be construed as affecting the appli-

cation of, or compliance with, any other provision of this Act to an
affected unit or source, including the provisions related to applica-
ble National Ambient Air Quality Standards and State implemen-
tation plans. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring
a change of any kind in any State law regulating electric utility
rates and charges or affecting any State law regarding such State
regulation or as limiting State regulation (including any prudency
review) under such a State law. Nothing in this section shall be
construed as modifying the Federal Power Act or as affecting the
authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under that
Act. Nothing in this title shall be construed to interfere with or im-
pair any program for competitive bidding for power supply in a
State in which such program is established. Allowances, once allo-
cated to a person by the Administrator, may be received, held, and
temporarily or permanently transferred in accordance with this
title and the regulations of the Administrator without regard to
whether or not a permit is in effect under title V or section 408
with respect to the unit for which such allowance was originally al-
located and recorded. Each permit under this title and each permit
issued under title V for any affected unit shall provide that the af-
fected unit may not emit an annual tonnage of sulfur dioxide in ex-
cess of the allowances held for that unit.
(g) PROHIBITION.—It shall be unlawful for any person to hold,
use, or transfer any allowance allocated under this title, except in
accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator. It
shall be unlawful for any affected unit to emit sulfur dioxide in ex-
cess of the number of allowances held for that unit for that year
by the owner or operator of the unit. Upon the allocation of allow-
ances under this title, the prohibition contained in the preceding
sentence shall supersede any other emission limitation applicable
under this title to the units for which such allowances are allo-
cated. Allowances may not be used prior to the calendar year for
which they are allocated. Nothing in this section or in the allow-
ance system regulations shall relieve the Administrator of the Ad-
ministrator’s permitting, monitoring and enforcement obligations

SEC. 404. PHASE I SULFUR DIOXIDE REQUIREMENTS.
(a) EMISSION LIMITATIONS.—(1) After January 1, 1995, each
source that includes one or more affected units listed in table A is
an affected source under this section. After January 1, 1995, it
shall be unlawful for any affected unit (other than an eligible phase
I unit under section 404(d)(2)) to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of
the tonnage limitation stated as a total number of allowances in
table A for phase I, unless (A) the emissions reduction require-
ments applicable to such unit have been achieved pursuant to sub-
section (b) or (d), or (B) the owner or operator of such unit holds
allowances to emit not less than the unit’s total annual emissions,
except that, after January 1, 2000, the emissions limitations estab-
lished in this section shall be superseded by those established in
section 405. The owner or operator of any unit in violation of this
section shall be fully liable for such violation including, but not lim-
ited to, liability for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 411.
(2) Not later than December 31, 1991, the Administrator shall
determine the total tonnage of reductions in the emissions of sulfur
dioxide from all utility units in calendar year 1995 that will occur
as a result of compliance with the emissions limitation require-
ments of this section, and shall establish a reserve of allowances
equal in amount to the number of tons determined thereby not to
exceed a total of 3.50 million tons. In making such a determination,
the Administrator shall compute for each unit subject to the emis-
sions limitation requirements of this section the difference be-
tween: (A) the product of its baseline multiplied by the lesser of
each unit’s allowable 1985 emissions rate and its actual 1985
emissions rate, divided by 2,000, and
(B) the product of each unit’s baseline multiplied by 2.50
lbs/mmBtu divided by 2,000,
and sum the computations. The Administrator shall adjust the
foregoing calculation to reflect projected calendar year 1995 utiliza-
tion of the units subject to the emissions limitations of this title
that the Administrator finds would have occurred in the absence of
the imposition of such requirements. Pursuant to subsection (d),
the Administrator shall allocate allowances from the reserve estab-
lished hereinunder until the earlier of such time as all such allow-
ances in the reserve are allocated or December 31, 1999.
(3) In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to paragraph
(1), in each calendar year beginning in 1995 and ending in 1999,
inclusive, the Administrator shall allocate for each unit on
Table 188 A that is located in the States 189 of Illinois, Indiana, or
Ohio (other than units at Kyger Creek, Clifty Creek and Joppa
Steam), allowances in an amount equal to 200,000 multiplied by

the unit’s pro rata share of the total number of allowances allo-
cated for all units on Table 188 A in the 3 States (other than units
at Kyger Creek, Clifty Creek, and Joppa Steam) pursuant to para-
graph (1). Such allowances shall be excluded from the calculation
of the reserve under paragraph (2).
(b) SUBSTITUTIONS.—The owner or operator of an affected unit
under subsection (a) may include in its section 408 permit applica-
tion and proposed compliance plan a proposal to reassign, in whole
or in part, the affected unit’s sulfur dioxide reduction requirements
to any other unit(s) under the control of such owner or operator.
Such proposal shall specify—
(1) the designation of the substitute unit or units to which
any part of the reduction obligations of subsection (a) shall be
required, in addition to, or in lieu of, any original affected
units designated under such subsection;
(2) the original affected unit’s baseline, the actual and al-
lowable 1985 emissions rate for sulfur dioxide, and the author-
ized annual allowance allocation stated in table A;
(3) calculation of the annual average tonnage for calendar
years 1985, 1986, and 1987, emitted by the substitute unit or
units, based on the baseline for each unit, as defined in section
402(d), 190 multiplied by the lesser of the unit’s actual or allow-
able 1985 emissions rate;
(4) the emissions rates and tonnage limitations that would
be applicable to the original and substitute affected units
under the substitution proposal;
(5) documentation, to the satisfaction of the Administrator,
that the reassigned tonnage limits will, in total, achieve the
same or greater emissions reduction than would have been
achieved by the original affected unit and the substitute unit
or units without such substitution; and
(6) such other information as the Administrator may re-
quire.
(c) ADMINISTRATOR’S ACTION ON SUBSTITUTION PROPOSALS.—(1)
The Administrator shall take final action on such substitution pro-
posal in accordance with section 408(c) if the substitution proposal
fulfills the requirements of this subsection. The Administrator may
approve a substitution proposal in whole or in part and with such
modifications or conditions as may be consistent with the orderly
functioning of the allowance system and which will ensure the
emissions reductions contemplated by this title. If a proposal does
not meet the requirements of subsection (b), the Administrator
shall disapprove it. The owner or operator of a unit listed in table
A shall not substitute another unit or units without the prior ap-
proval of the Administrator.
(2) Upon approval of a substitution proposal, each substitute
unit, and each source with such unit, shall be deemed affected
under this title, and the Administrator shall issue a permit to the
original and substitute affected source and unit in accordance with
the approved substitution plan and section 408. The Administrator
shall allocate allowances for the original and substitute affected
units in accordance with the approved substitution proposal pursu-

ant to section 403. It shall be unlawful for any source or unit that
is allocated allowances pursuant to this section to emit sulfur diox-
ide in excess of the emissions limitation provided for in the ap-
proved substitution permit and plan unless the owner or operator
of each unit governed by the permit and approved substitution plan
holds allowances to emit not less than the units 191 total annual
emissions. The owner or operator of any original or substitute af-
fected unit operated in violation of this subsection shall be fully lia-
ble for such violation, including liability for fulfilling the obliga-
tions specified in section 411 of this title. If a substitution proposal
is disapproved, the Administrator shall allocate allowances to the
original affected unit or units in accordance with subsection (a).
(d) ELIGIBLE PHASE I EXTENSION UNITS.—(1) The owner or op-
erator of any affected unit subject to an emissions limitation re-
quirement under this section may petition the Administrator in its
permit application under section 408 for an extension of 2 years of
the deadline for meeting such requirement, provided that the
owner or operator of any such unit holds allowances to emit not
less than the unit’s total annual emissions for each of the 2 years
of the period of extension. To qualify for such an extension, the af-
fected unit must either employ a qualifying phase I technology, or
transfer its phase I emissions reduction obligation to a unit em-
ploying a qualifying phase I technology. Such transfer shall be ac-
complished in accordance with a compliance plan, submitted and
approved under section 408, that shall govern operations at all
units included in the transfer, and that specifies the emissions re-
duction requirements imposed pursuant to this title.
(2) Such extension proposal shall—
(A) specify the unit or units proposed for designation as an
eligible phase I extension unit;
(B) provide a copy of an executed contract, which may be
contingent upon the Administrator approving the proposal, for
the design engineering, and construction of the qualifying
phase I technology for the extension unit, or for the unit or
units to which the extension unit’s emission reduction obliga-
tion is to be transferred;
(C) specify the unit’s or units’ baseline, actual 1985 emis-
sions rate, allowable 1985 emissions rate, and projected utiliza-
tion for calendar years 1995 through 1999;
(D) require CEMS on both the eligible phase I extension
unit or units and the transfer unit or units beginning no later
than January 1, 1995; and
(E) specify the emission limitation and number of allow-
ances expected to be necessary for annual operation after the
qualifying phase I technology has been installed.
(3) The Administrator shall review and take final action on
each extension proposal in order of receipt, consistent with section
408, and for an approved proposal shall designate the unit or units
as an eligible phase I extension unit. The Administrator may ap-
prove an extension proposal in whole or in part, and with such
modifications or conditions as may be necessary, consistent with

the orderly functioning of the allowance system, and to ensure the
emissions reductions contemplated by the 192 title.
(4) In order to determine the number of proposals eligible for
allocations from the reserve under subsection (a)(2) and the num-
ber of allowances remaining available after each proposal is acted
upon, the Administrator shall reduce the total number of allow-
ances remaining available in the reserve by the number of allow-
ances calculated according to subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) until
either no allowances remain available in the reserve for further al-
location or all approved proposals have been acted upon. If no al-
lowances remain available in the reserve for further allocation be-
fore all proposals have been acted upon by the Administrator, any
pending proposals shall be disapproved. The Administrator shall
calculate allowances equal to—
(A) the difference between the lesser of the average annual
emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or the projected
emissions tonnage for calendar year 1995 of each eligible phase
I extension unit, as designated under paragraph (3), and the
product of the unit’s baseline multiplied by an emission rate of
2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000;
(B) the difference between the lesser of the average annual
emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or the projected
emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 of each eligible phase
I extension unit, as designated under paragraph (3), and the
product of the unit’s baseline multiplied by an emission rate of
2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000; and
(C) the amount by which (i) the product of each unit’s
baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, di-
vided by 2,000, exceeds (ii) the tonnage level specified under
subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection multiplied
by a factor of 3.
(5) Each eligible Phase I extension unit shall receive allow-
ances determined under subsection (a)(1) or (c) of this section. In
addition, for calendar year 1995, the Administrator shall allocate
to each eligible Phase I extension unit, from the allowance reserve
created pursuant to subsection (a)(2), allowances equal to the dif-
ference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in cal-
endar years 1988 and 1989 or its projected emissions tonnage for
calendar year 1995 and the product of the unit’s baseline multi-
plied by an emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000. In
calendar year 1996, the Administrator shall allocate for each eligi-
ble unit, from the allowance reserve created pursuant to subsection
(a)(2), allowances equal to the difference between the lesser of the
average annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its
projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 and the product
of the unit’s baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2.50 lbs/
mmBtu, divided by 2,000. It shall be unlawful for any source or
unit subject to an approved extension plan under this subsection to
emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the emissions limitations provided
for in the permit and approved extension plan, unless the owner
or operator of each unit governed by the permit and approved plan

holds allowances to emit not less than the unit’s total annual emis-
sions.
(6) In addition to allowances specified in paragraph (5), the Ad-
ministrator shall allocate for each eligible Phase I extension unit
employing qualifying Phase I technology, for calendar years 1997,
1998, and 1999, additional allowances, from any remaining allow-
ances in the reserve created pursuant to subsection (a)(2), following
the reduction in the reserve provided for in paragraph (4), not to
exceed the amount by which (A) the product of each eligible unit’s
baseline times an emission rate of 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by
2,000, exceeds (B) the tonnage level specified under subparagraph
(E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(7) After January 1, 1997, in addition to any liability under
this Act, including under section 411, if any eligible phase I exten-
sion unit employing qualifying phase I technology or any transfer
unit under this subsection emits sulfur dioxide in excess of the an-
nual tonnage limitation specified in the extension plan, as ap-
proved in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Administrator shall,
in the calendar year following such excess, deduct allowances equal
to the amount of such excess from such unit’s annual allowance al-
location.
(e)(1) In the case of a unit that receives authorization from the
Governor of the State in which such unit is located to make reduc-
tions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide prior to calendar year 1995
and that is part of a utility system that meets the following re-
quirements: (A) the total coal-fired generation within the utility
system as a percentage of total system generation decreased by
more than 20 percent between January 1, 1980, and December 31,
1985; and (B) the weighted capacity factor of all coal-fired units
within the utility system averaged over the period from January 1,
1985, through December 31, 1987, was below 50 percent, the Ad-
ministrator shall allocate allowances under this paragraph for the
unit pursuant to this subsection. The Administrator shall allocate
allowances for a unit that is an affected unit pursuant to section
405 (but is not also an affected unit under this section) and part
of a utility system that includes 1 or more affected units under sec-
tion 405 for reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide made dur-
ing the period 1995–1999 if the unit meets the requirements of this
subsection and the requirements of the preceding sentence, except
that for the purposes of applying this subsection to any such unit,
the prior year concerned as specified below, shall be any year after
January 1, 1995 but prior to January 1, 2000.
(2) In the case of an affected unit under this section described
in subparagraph (A), 193 the allowances allocated under this sub-
section for early reductions in any prior year may not exceed the
amount which (A) the product of the unit’s baseline multiplied by
the unit’s 1985 actual sulfur dioxide emission rate (in lbs. per
mmBtu), divided by 2,000, exceeds (B) the allowances specified for
such unit in Table A. In the case of an affected unit under section
405 described in subparagraph (A), 193 the allowances awarded
under this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may
not exceed the amount by which (i) the product of the quantity of

ances allocated under this subsection for units referred to in sub-
paragraph (A) 193 may be allocated only for emission reductions
achieved as a result of physical changes or changes in the method

(C) ELECTRIC UTILITY.—The term ‘‘electric utility’’
means any person, State agency, or Federal agency, which
sells electric energy.
(2) A LLOWANCES FOR EMISSIONS AVOIDED THROUGH ENERGY
CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE ENERGY.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The regulations under paragraph (4)
of this subsection shall provide that for each ton of sulfur
dioxide emissions avoided by an electric utility, during the
applicable period, through the use of qualified energy con-
servation measures or qualified renewable energy, the Ad-
ministrator shall allocate a single allowance to such elec-
tric utility, on a first-come-first-served basis from the Con-
servation and Renewable Energy Reserve established
under subsection (g), up to a total of 300,000 allowances
for allocation from such Reserve.
(B) REQUIREMENTS FOR ISSUANCE.—The Administrator
shall allocate allowances to an electric utility under this
subsection only if all of the following requirements are
met: (i) Such electric utility is paying for the qualified
energy conservation measures or qualified renewable
energy directly or through purchase from another per-
son. (ii) The emissions of sulfur dioxide avoided
through the use of qualified energy conservation meas-
ures or qualified renewable energy are quantified in
accordance with regulations promulgated by the Ad-
ministrator under this subsection.
(iii)(I) Such electric utility has adopted and is im-
plementing a least cost energy conservation and elec-
tric power plan which evaluates a range of resources,
including new power supplies, energy conservation,
and renewable energy resources, in order to meet ex-
pected future demand at the lowest system cost.
(II) The qualified energy conservation measures or
qualified renewable energy, or both, are consistent
with that plan.
(III) Electric utilities subject to the jurisdiction of
a State regulatory authority must have such plan ap-
proved by such authority. For electric utilities not sub-
ject to the jurisdiction of a State regulatory authority
such plan shall be approved by the entity with rate-
making authority for such utility.
(iv) In the case of qualified energy conservation
measures undertaken by a State regulated electric
utility, the Secretary of Energy certifies that the State
regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the electric
rates of such electric utility has established rates and
charges which ensure that the net income of such elec-
tric utility after implementation of specific cost effec-
tive energy conservation measures is at least as high
as such net income would have been if the energy con-
servation measures had not been implemented. Upon
the date of any such certification by the Secretary of

196 Probably should be a semicolon instead of a comma.
Energy, all allowances which, but for this paragraph,
would have been allocated under subparagraph (A) be-
fore such date, shall be allocated to the electric utility.
This clause is not a requirement for qualified renew-
able energy.
(v) Such utility or any subsidiary of the utility’s
holding company owns or operates at least one af-
fected unit.
(C) PERIOD OF APPLICABILITY.—Allowances under this
subsection shall be allocated only with respect to kilowatt
hours of electric energy saved by qualified energy con-
servation measures or generated by qualified renewable
energy after January 1, 1992 and before the earlier of (i)
December 31, 2000, or (ii) the date on which any electric
utility steam generating unit owned or operated by the
electric utility to which the allowances are allocated be-
comes subject to this title (including those sources that
elect to become affected by this title, pursuant to section
410).
(D) DETERMINATION OF AVOIDED EMISSIONS.—
(i) APPLICATION.—In order to receive allowances
under this subsection, an electric utility shall make an
application which—
(I) designates the qualified energy conserva-
tion measures implemented and the qualified re-
newable energy sources used for purposes of
avoiding emissions, 196
(II) calculates, in accordance with subpara-
graphs (F) and (G), the number of tons of emis-
sions avoided by reason of the implementation of
such measures or the use of such renewable en-
ergy sources; and
(III) demonstrates that the requirements of
subparagraph (B) have been met.
Such application for allowances by a State-regulated
electric utility shall require approval by the State reg-
ulatory authority with jurisdiction over such electric
utility. The authority shall review the application for
accuracy and compliance with this subsection and the
rules under this subsection. Electric utilities whose re-
tail rates are not subject to the jurisdiction of a State
regulatory authority shall apply directly to the Admin-
istrator for such approval.
(E) AVOIDED EMISSIONS FROM QUALIFIED ENERGY CON-
SERVATION MEASURES.—For the purposes of this sub-
section, the emission tonnage deemed avoided by reason of
the implementation of qualified energy conservation meas-
ures for any calendar year shall be a tonnage equal to the
product of multiplying—
(i) the kilowatt hours that would otherwise have
been supplied by the utility during such year in the

and dividing by 2,000.
(F) AVOIDED EMISSIONS FROM THE USE OF QUALIFIED
RENEWABLE ENERGY.—The emissions tonnage deemed
avoided by reason of the use of qualified renewable energy
by an electric utility for any calendar year shall be a ton-
nage equal to the product of multiplying—
(i) the actual kilowatt hours generated by, or pur-
chased from, qualified renewable energy, by
(ii) 0.004,
and dividing by 2,000.
(G) PROHIBITIONS.—(i) No allowances shall be allo-
cated under this subsection for the implementation of pro-
grams that are exclusively informational or educational in
nature.
(ii) No allowances shall be allocated for energy con-
servation measures or renewable energy that were oper-
ational before January 1, 1992.
(3) SAVINGS PROVISION.—Nothing in this subsection pre-
cludes a State or State regulatory authority from providing ad-
ditional incentives to utilities to encourage investment in de-
mand-side resources.
(4) REGULATIONS.—Not later than 18 months after the
date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 and in conjunction with the regulations required to be
promulgated under subsections (b) and (c), the Administrator
shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, promulgate
regulations under this subsection. Such regulations shall list
energy conservation measures and renewable energy sources
which may be treated as qualified energy conservation meas-
ures and qualified renewable energy for purposes of this sub-
section. Allowances shall only be allocated if all requirements
of this subsection and the rules promulgated to implement this
subsection are complied with. The Administrator shall review
the determinations of each State regulatory authority under
this subsection to encourage consistency from electric utility to
electric utility and from State to State in accordance with the
Administrator’s rules. The Administrator shall publish the
findings of this review no less than annually.
(g) CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE ENERGY RESERVE.—The
Administrator shall establish a Conservation and Renewable En-
ergy Reserve under this subsection. Beginning on January 1, 1995,
the Administrator may allocate from the Conservation and Renew-
able Energy Reserve an amount equal to a total of 300,000 allow-
ances for emissions of sulfur dioxide pursuant to section 403. In
order to provide 300,000 allowances for such reserve, in each year
beginning in calendar year 2000 and until calendar year 2009, in-
clusive, the Administrator shall reduce each unit’s basic Phase II
allowance allocation on the basis of its pro rata share of 30,000 al-
lowances. If allowances remain in the reserve after January 2,
2010, the Administrator shall allocate such allowances for affected
units under section 405 on a pro rata basis. For purposes of this

subsection, for any unit subject to the emissions limitation require-
ments of section 405, the term ‘‘pro rata basis’’ refers to the ratio
which the reductions made in such unit’s allowances in order to es-
tablish the reserve under this subsection bears to the total of such
reductions for all such units.
(h) ALTERNATIVE ALLOWANCE ALLOCATION FOR UNITS IN CER-
TAIN UTILITY SYSTEMS WITH OPTIONAL BASELINE.—
(1) OPTIONAL BASELINE FOR UNITS IN CERTAIN SYSTEMS.—
In the case of a unit subject to the emissions limitation re-
quirements of this section which (as of the date of the enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990)—
(A) has an emission rate below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu,
(B) has decreased its sulfur dioxide emissions rate by
60 percent or greater since 1980, and
(C) is part of a utility system which has a weighted
average sulfur dioxide emissions rate for all fossil fueled-
fired units below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu,
at the election of the owner or operator of such unit, the unit’s
baseline may be calculated (i) as provided under section
402(d), 197 or (ii) by utilizing the unit’s average annual fuel con-
sumption at a 60 percent capacity factor. Such election shall be
made no later than March 1, 1991.
(2) ALLOWANCE ALLOCATION.—Whenever a unit referred to
in paragraph (1) elects to calculate its baseline as provided in
clause (ii) of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall allocate al-
lowances for the unit pursuant to section 403(a)(1), this sec-
tion, and section 405 (as basic Phase II allowance allocations)
in an amount equal to the baseline selected multiplied by the
lower of the average annual emission rate for such unit in
1989, or 1.0 lbs./mmBtu. Such allowance allocation shall be in
lieu of any allocation of allowances under this section and sec-
tion 405.

SEC. 405. PHASE II SULFUR DIOXIDE REQUIREMENTS.
(a) APPLICABILITY.—(1) After January 1, 2000, each existing
utility unit as provided below is subject to the limitations or re-
quirements of this section. Each utility unit subject to an annual
sulfur dioxide tonnage emission limitation under this section is an
affected unit under this title. Each source that includes one or
more affected units is an affected source. In the case of an existing
unit that was not in operation during calendar year 1985, the emis-
sion rate for a calendar year after 1985, as determined by the Ad-
ministrator, shall be used in lieu of the 1985 rate. The owner or
operator of any unit operated in violation of this section shall be
fully liable under this Act for fulfilling the obligations specified in
section 411 of this title.
(2) In addition to basic Phase II allowance allocations, in each
year beginning in calendar year 2000 and ending in calendar year
2009, inclusive, the Administrator shall allocate up to 530,000
Phase II bonus allowances pursuant to subsections (b)(2), (c)(4),
(d)(3)(A) and (B), and (h)(2) of this section and section 406. Not

later than June 1, 1998, the Administrator shall calculate, for each
unit granted an extension pursuant to section 409 the difference
between (A) the number of allowances allocated for the unit in cal-
endar year 2000, and (B) the product of the unit’s baseline multi-
plied by 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2000, and sum the computa-
tions. In each year, beginning in calendar year 2000 and ending in
calendar year 2009, inclusive, the Administrator shall deduct from
each unit’s basic Phase II allowance allocation its pro rata share
of 10 percent of the sum calculated pursuant to the preceding sen-
tence.
(3) In addition to basic Phase II allowance allocations and
Phase II bonus allowance allocations, beginning January 1, 2000,
the Administrator shall allocate for each unit listed on Table A in
section 404 (other than units at Kyger Creek, Clifty Creek, and
Joppa Steam) and located in the States 198 of Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Kentucky, or Tennessee allowances in an amount equal to 50,000
multiplied by the unit’s pro rata share of the total number of basic
allowances allocated for all units listed on Table A (other than
units at Kyger Creek, Clifty Creek, and Joppa Steam). Allowances
allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to the
8,900,000 ton limitation in section 403(a).
(b) U NITS EQUAL TO, OR ABOVE, 75 MWE AND 1.20 LBS/
MMBTU.—(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), after
January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful for any existing utility unit
that serves a generator with nameplate capacity equal to, or great-
er, than 75 MWe and an actual 1985 emission rate equal to or
greater than 1.20 lbs/mmBtu to exceed an annual sulfur dioxide
tonnage emission limitation equal to the product of the unit’s base-
line multiplied by an emission rate equal to 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, di-
vided by 2,000, unless the owner or operator of such unit holds al-
lowances to emit not less than the unit’s total annual emissions.
(2) In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to paragraph
(1) and section 403(a)(1) as basic Phase II allowance allocations, be-
ginning January 1, 2000, and for each calendar year thereafter
until and including 2009, the Administrator shall allocate annually
for each unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of
paragraph (1) with an actual 1985 emissions rate greater than 1.20
lbs/mmBtu and less than 2.50 lbs/mmBtu and a baseline capacity
factor of less than 60 percent, allowances from the reserve created
pursuant to subsection (a)(2) in an amount equal to 1.20 lbs/
mmBtu multiplied by 50 percent of the difference, on a Btu basis,
between the unit’s baseline and the unit’s fuel consumption at a 60
percent capacity factor.
(3) After January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful for any existing
utility unit with an actual 1985 emissions rate equal to or greater
than 1.20 lbs/mmBtu whose annual average fuel consumption dur-
ing 1985, 1986, and 1987 on a Btu basis exceeded 90 percent in the
form of lignite coal which is located in a State in which, as of July

rate or its allowable 1985 emissions rate, divided by 2,000, unless
the owner or operator of such unit holds allowances to emit not less
than the unit’s total annual emissions.
(4) After January 1, 2000, the Administrator shall allocate an-
nually for each unit, subject to the emissions limitation require-
ments of paragraph (1), which is located in a State with an in-
stalled electrical generating capacity of more than 30,000,000 kw
in 1988 and for which was issued a prohibition order or a proposed
prohibition order (from burning oil), which unit subsequently con-
verted to coal between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1985, al-
lowances equal to the difference between (A) the product of the
unit’s annual fuel consumption, on a Btu basis, at a 65 percent ca-
pacity factor multiplied by the lesser of its actual or allowable
emissions rate during the first full calendar year after conversion,
divided by 2,000, and (B) the number of allowances allocated for
the unit pursuant to paragraph (1): Provided, That the number of
allowances allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed
an annual total of five thousand. If necessary to meeting the re-
striction imposed in the preceding sentence the Administrator shall
reduce, pro rata, the annual allowances allocated for each unit
under this paragraph.
(c) C OAL OR OIL-FIRED UNITS BELOW 75 MWE AND ABOVE 1.20
LBS/MMBTU.—(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3),
after January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful for a coal or oil-fired ex-
isting utility unit that serves a generator with nameplate capacity
of less than 75 MWe and an actual 1985 emission rate equal to,

SEC. 407. NITROGEN OXIDES EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM.
(a) APPLICABILITY.—On the date that a coal-fired utility unit
becomes an affected unit pursuant to sections 404, 405, 213 409, or
on the date a unit subject to the provisions of section 404(d) or
409(b), must meet the SO2 reduction requirements, each such unit
shall become an affected unit for purposes of this section and shall
be subject to the emission limitations for nitrogen oxides set forth
herein.
(b) EMISSION LIMITATIONS.—(1) Not later than eighteen months
after enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Ad-
ministrator shall by regulation establish annual allowable emission
limitations for nitrogen oxides for the types of utility boilers listed
below, which limitations shall not exceed the rates listed below:
Provided, That the Administrator may set a rate higher than that
listed for any type of utility boiler if the Administrator finds that
the maximum listed rate for that boiler type cannot be achieved
using low NOx burner technology. The maximum allowable emis-
sion rates are as follows:
(A) for tangentially fired boilers, 0.45 lb/mmBtu;
(B) for dry bottom wall-fired boilers (other than units ap-
plying cell burner technology), 0.50 lb/mmBtu.
After January 1, 1995, it shall be unlawful for any unit that is an
affected unit on that date and is of the type listed in this para-
graph to emit nitrogen oxides in excess of the emission rates set
by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph.
(2) Not later than January 1, 1997, the Administrator shall, by
regulation, establish allowable emission limitations on a lb/mmBtu,
annual average basis, for nitrogen oxides for the following types of
utility boilers:
(A) wet bottom wall-fired boilers;
(B) cyclones;
(C) units applying cell burner technology;
(D) all other types of utility boilers.
The Administrator shall base such rates on the degree of reduction
achievable through the retrofit application of the best system of
continuous emission reduction, taking into account available tech-
nology, costs and energy and environmental impacts; and which is
comparable to the costs of nitrogen oxides controls set pursuant to
subsection (b)(1). Not later than January 1, 1997, the Adminis-
trator may revise the applicable emission limitations for tangen-
tially fired and dry bottom, wall-fired boilers (other than cell burn-
ers) to be more stringent if the Administrator determines that more
effective low NOx burner technology is available: Provided, That, no
unit that is an affected unit pursuant to section 404 and that is
subject to the requirements of subsection (b)(1), shall be subject to
the revised emission limitations, if any.

(c) REVISED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.—(1) Not later than
January 1, 1993, the Administrator shall propose revised standards
of performance to section 111 for nitrogen oxides emissions from
fossil-fuel fired steam generating units, including both electric util-
ity and nonutility units. Not later than January 1, 1994, the Ad-
ministrator shall promulgate such revised standards of perform-
ance. Such revised standards of performance shall reflect improve-
ments in methods for the reduction of emissions of oxides of nitro-
gen. (d) ALTERNATIVE EMISSION LIMITATIONS.—The permitting au-
thority shall, upon request of an owner or operator of a unit subject
to this section, authorize an emission limitation less stringent than
the applicable limitation established under subsection (b)(1) or
(b)(2) upon a determination that—
(1) a unit subject to subsection (b)(1) cannot meet the ap-
plicable limitation using low NOx burner technology; or
(2) a unit subject to subsection (b)(2) cannot meet the ap-
plicable rate using the technology on which the Administrator
based the applicable emission limitation.
The permitting authority shall base such determination upon a
showing satisfactory to the permitting authority, in accordance
with regulations established by the Administrator not later than
eighteen months after enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, that the owner or operator—
(1) 214 has properly installed appropriate control equipment
designed to meet the applicable emission rate;
(2) 215 has properly operated such equipment for a period
of fifteen months (or such other period of time as the Adminis-
trator determines through the regulations), and provides oper-
ating and monitoring data for such period demonstrating that
the unit cannot meet the applicable emission rate; and
(3) 216 has specified an emission rate that such unit can
meet on an annual average basis.
The permitting authority shall issue an operating permit for the
unit in question, in accordance with section 408 and part B of title
III 217 —
(i) that permits the unit during the demonstration period
referred to in subparagraph (2) above, to emit at a rate in ex-
cess of the applicable emission rate;
(ii) at the conclusion of the demonstration period to revise
the operating permit to reflect the alternative emission rate
demonstrated in paragraphs (2) and (3) above.
Units subject to subsection (b)(1) for which an alternative emission
limitation is established shall not be required to install any addi-
tional control technology beyond low NOx burners. Nothing in this
section shall preclude an owner or operator from installing and op-
erating an alternative NOx control technology capable of achieving

the applicable emission limitation. If the owner or operator of a
unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of subsection
(b)(1) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the
technology necessary to meet such requirements is not in adequate
supply to enable its installation and operation at the unit, con-
sistent with system reliability, by January 1, 1995, then the Ad-
ministrator shall extend the deadline for compliance for the unit by
a period of 15 months. Any owner or operator may petition the Ad-
ministrator to make a determination under the previous sentence.
The Administrator shall grant or deny such petition within 3
months of submittal.
(e) EMISSIONS AVERAGING.—In lieu of complying with the ap-
plicable emission limitations under subsection (b) (1), (2), or (d), the
owner or operator of two or more units subject to one or more of
the applicable emission limitations set pursuant to these sections,
may petition the permitting authority for alternative contempora-
neous annual emission limitations for such units that ensure that
(1) the actual annual emission rate in pounds of nitrogen oxides
per million Btu averaged over the units in question is a rate that
is less than or equal to (2) the Btu-weighted average annual emis-
sion rate for the same units if they had been operated, during the
same period of time, in compliance with limitations set in accord-
ance with the applicable emission rates set pursuant to sub-
sections 218 (b) (1) and (2).
If the permitting authority determines, in accordance with reg-
ulations issued by the Administrator not later than eighteen
months after enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990; 219 that the conditions in the paragraph above can be met,
the permitting authority shall issue operating permits for such
units, in accordance with section 408 and part B of title III, 220 that
allow alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations.
Such emission limitations shall only remain in effect while both
units continue operation under the conditions specified in their re-
spective operating permits.

(a) PERMIT PROGRAM.—The provisions of this title shall be im-
plemented, subject to section 403, by permits issued to units sub-
ject to this title (and enforced) in accordance with the provisions of
title V, as modified by this title. Any such permit issued by the Ad-
ministrator, or by a State with an approved permit program, shall
prohibit—
(1) annual emissions of sulfur dioxide in excess of the
number of allowances to emit sulfur dioxide the owner or oper-
ator, or the designated representative of the owners or opera-
tors, of the unit hold for the unit,
(2) exceedances of applicable emissions rates,
(3) the use of any allowance prior to the year for which it
was allocated, and
(4) contravention of any other provision of the permit.

Permits issued to implement this title shall be issued for a period
of 5 years, notwithstanding title V. No permit shall be issued that
is inconsistent with the requirements of this title, and title V as
applicable.
(b) COMPLIANCE PLAN.—Each initial permit application shall
be accompanied by a compliance plan for the source to comply with
its requirements under this title. Where an affected source consists
of more than one affected unit, such plan shall cover all such units,
and for purposes of section 502(c), such source shall be considered
a ‘‘facility’’. Nothing in this section regarding compliance plans or
in title V shall be construed as affecting allowances. Except as pro-
vided under subsection (c)(1)(B), submission of a statement by the
owner or operator, or the designated representative of the owners
and operators, of a unit subject to the emissions limitation require-
ments of sections 404, 405, and 407, that the unit will meet the ap-
plicable emissions limitation requirements of such sections in a
timely manner or that, in the case of the emissions limitation re-
quirements of sections 404 and 405, the owners and operators will
hold allowances to emit not less than the total annual emissions of
the unit, shall be deemed to meet the proposed and approved com-
pliance planning requirements of this section and title V, except
that, for any unit that will meet the requirements of this title by
means of an alternative method of compliance authorized under
section 404 (b), (c), (d), or (f) 221 section 407 (d) or (e), section 409
and section 410, the proposed and approved compliance plan, per-
mit application and permit shall include, pursuant to regulations
promulgated by the Administrator, for each alternative method of
compliance a comprehensive description of the schedule and means
by which the unit will rely on one or more alternative methods of
compliance in the manner and time authorized under this title.
Recordation by the Administrator of transfers of allowances shall
amend automatically all applicable proposed or approved permit
applications, compliance plans and permits. The Administrator
may also require—
(1) for a source, a demonstration of attainment of national
ambient air quality standards, and
(2) from the owner or operator of two or more affected
sources, an integrated compliance plan providing an overall
plan for achieving compliance at the affected sources.
(c) FIRST PHASE PERMITS.—The Administrator shall issue per-
mits to affected sources under sections 404 and 407.
(1) PERMIT APPLICATION AND COMPLIANCE PLAN.—(A) Not
later than 27 months after the date of the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the designated representa-
tive of the owners or operators, or the owner and operator, of
each affected source under sections 404 and 407 shall submit
a permit application and compliance plan for that source in ac-
cordance with regulations issued by the Administrator under
paragraph (3). The permit application and the compliance plan
shall be binding on the owner or operator or the designated
representative of owners and operators for purposes of this

title and section 402(a), 222 and shall be enforceable in lieu of
a permit until a permit is issued by the Administrator for the
source.
(B) In the case of a compliance plan for an affected source
under sections 404 and 407 for which the owner or operator
proposes to meet the requirements of that section by reducing
utilization of the unit as compared with its baseline or by shut-
ting down the unit, the owner or operator shall include in the
proposed compliance plan a specification of the unit or units
that will provide electrical generation to compensate for the re-
duced output at the affected source, or a demonstration that
such reduced utilization will be accomplished through energy
conservation or improved unit efficiency. The unit to be used
for such compensating generation, which is not otherwise an
affected unit under sections 404 and 407, shall be deemed an
affected unit under section 404, subject to all of the require-
ments for such units under this title, except that allowances
shall be allocated to such compensating unit in the amount of
an annual limitation equal to the product of the unit’s baseline
multiplied by the lesser of the unit’s actual 1985 emissions rate
or its allowable 1985 emissions rate, divided by 2,000.
(2) EPA ACTION ON COMPLIANCE PLANS.—The Adminis-
trator shall review each proposed compliance plan to determine
whether it satisfies the requirements of this title, and shall ap-
prove or disapprove such plan within 6 months after receipt of
a complete submission. If a plan is disapproved, it may be re-
submitted for approval with such changes as the Administrator
shall require consistent with the requirements of this title and
within such period as the Administrator prescribes as part of
such disapproval.
(3) REGULATIONS; ISSUANCE OF PERMITS.—Not later than
18 months after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall promulgate reg-
ulations, in accordance with title V, to implement a Federal
permit program to issue permits for affected sources under this
title. Following promulgation, the Administrator shall issue a
permit to implement the requirements of section 404 and the
allowances provided under section 403 to the owner or operator
of each affected source under section 404. Such a permit shall
supersede any permit application and compliance plan sub-
mitted under paragraph (1).
(4) FEES.—During the years 1995 through 1999 inclusive,
no fee shall be required to be paid under section 502(b)(3) or
under section 110(a)(2)(L) with respect to emissions from any
unit which is an affected unit under section 404.
(d) SECOND PHASE PERMITS.—(1) To provide for permits for (A)
new electric utility steam generating units required under section
403(e) to have allowances, (B) affected units or sources under sec-
tion 405, and (C) existing units subject to nitrogen oxide emission
reductions under section 407, each State in which one or more such
units or sources are located shall submit in accordance with title
V, a permit program for approval as provided by that title. Upon

approved program the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of
permits as provided in title V.
(2) The owner or operator or the designated representative of
each affected source under section 405 shall submit a permit appli-
cation and compliance plan for that source to the permitting au-
thority, not later than January 1, 1996.
(3) Not later than December 31, 1997, each State with an ap-
proved permit program shall issue permits to the owner or oper-
ator, or the designated representative of the owners and operators,
of affected sources under section 405 that satisfy the requirements
of title V and this title and that submitted to such State a permit
application and compliance plan pursuant to paragraph (2). In the
case of a State without an approved permit program by July 1,
1996, the Administrator shall, not later than January 1, 1998,
issue a permit to the owner or operator or the designated rep-
resentative of each such affected source. In the case of affected
sources for which applications and plans are timely received under
paragraph (2), the permit application and the compliance plan, in-
cluding amendments thereto, shall be binding on the owner or op-
erator or the designated representative of the owners or operators
and shall be enforceable as a permit for purposes of this title and
title V until a permit is issued by the permitting authority for the
affected source. The provisions of section 558(c) of title V of the
United States Code (relating to renewals) shall apply to permits
issued by a permitting authority under this title and title V.
(4) The permit issued in accordance with this subsection for an
affected source shall provide that the affected units at the affected
source may not emit an annual tonnage of sulfur dioxide in excess
of the number of allowances to emit sulfur dioxide the owner or op-
erator or designated representative hold for the unit.
(e) NEW UNITS.—The owner or operator of each source that in-
cludes a new electric utility steam generating unit shall submit a
permit application and compliance plan to the permitting authority
not later than 24 months before the later of (1) January 1, 2000,
or (2) the date on which the unit commences operation. The permit-
ting authority shall issue a permit to the owner or operator, or the
designated representative thereof, of the unit that satisfies the re-
quirements of title V and this title.
(f) UNITS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LIMITS.—The owner or
operator, or designated representative thereof, of any unit subject
to an emission rate requirement under section 407 shall submit a
permit application and compliance plan for such unit to the permit-
ting authority, not later than January 1, 1998. The permitting au-
thority shall issue a permit to the owner or operator that satisfies
the requirements of title V and this title, including any appropriate
monitoring and reporting requirements.
(g) AMENDMENT OF APPLICATION AND COMPLIANCE PLAN.—At
any time after the submission of an application and compliance
plan under this section, the applicant may submit a revised appli-
cation and compliance plan, in accordance with the requirements
of this section. In considering any permit application and compli-
ance plan under this title, the permitting authority shall ensure co-

ordination with the applicable electric ratemaking authority, in the
case of regulated utilities, and with unregulated public utilities.
(h) PROHIBITION.—(1) It shall be unlawful for an owner or oper-
ator, or designated representative, required to submit a permit ap-
plication or compliance plan under this title to fail to submit such
application or plan in accordance with the deadlines specified in
this section or to otherwise fail to comply with regulations imple-
menting this section.
(2) It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any source
subject to this title except in compliance with the terms and re-
quirements of a permit application and compliance plan (including
amendments thereto) or permit issued by the Administrator or a
State with an approved permit program. For purposes of this sub-
section, compliance, as provided in section 504(f), with a permit
issued under title V which complies with this title for sources sub-
ject to this title shall be deemed compliance with this subsection
as well as section 502(a).
(3) In order to ensure reliability of electric power, nothing in
this title or title V shall be construed as requiring termination of
operations of an electric utility steam generating unit for failure to
have an approved permit or compliance plan, except that any such
unit may be subject to the applicable enforcement provisions of sec-
tion 113.
(i) MULTIPLE OWNERS.—No permit shall be issued under this
section to an affected unit until the designated representative of
the owners or operators has filed a certificate of representation
with regard to matters under this title, including the holding and
distribution of allowances and the proceeds of transactions involv-
ing allowances. Where there are multiple holders of a legal or equi-
table title to, or a leasehold interest in, such a unit, or where a
utility or industrial customer purchases power from an affected
unit (or units) under life-of-the-unit, firm power contractual ar-
rangements, the certificate shall state (1) that allowances and the
proceeds of transactions involving allowances will be deemed to be
held or distributed in proportion to each holder’s legal, equitable,
leasehold, or contractual reservation or entitlement, or (2) if such
multiple holders have expressly provided for a different distribu-
tion of allowances by contract, that allowances and the proceeds of
transactions involving allowances will be deemed to be held or dis-
tributed in accordance with the contract. A passive lessor, or a per-
son who has an equitable interest through such lessor, whose rent-
al payments are not based, either directly or indirectly, upon the
revenues or income from the affected unit shall not be deemed to
be a holder of a legal, equitable, leasehold, or contractual interest
for the purpose of holding or distributing allowances as provided in
this subsection, during either the term of such leasehold or there-
after, unless expressly provided for in the leasehold agreement. Ex-
cept as otherwise provided in this subsection, where all legal or eq-
uitable title to or interest in an affected unit is held by a single
person, the certification shall state that all allowances received by
the unit are deemed to be held for that person.

(a) AVAILABILITY.—Not later than December 31, 1997, the
owner or operator of an existing unit subject to the emissions limi-
tation requirements of section 405 (b) and 223 (c) may demonstrate
to the permitting authority that one or more units will be repow-
ered with a qualifying clean coal technology to comply with the re-
quirements under section 405. The owner or operator shall, as part
of any such demonstration, provide, not later than January 1, 2000,
satisfactory documentation of a preliminary design and engineering
effort for such repowering and an executed and binding contract for
the majority of the equipment to repower such unit and such other
information as the Administrator may require by regulation. The
replacement of an existing utility unit with a new utility unit using
a repowering technology referred to in section 402(2) 224 which is
located at a different site, shall be treated as repowering of the ex-
isting unit for purposes of this title, if—
(1) the replacement unit is designated by the owner or op-
erator to replace such existing unit, and
(2) the existing unit is retired from service on or before the
date on which the designated replacement unit enters commer-
cial operation.
(b) EXTENSION.—(1) An owner or operator satisfying the re-
quirements of subsection (a) shall be granted an extension of the
emission limitation requirement compliance date for that unit from
January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2003. The extension shall be
specified in the permit issued to the source under section 408, to-
gether with any compliance schedule and other requirements nec-
essary to meet second phase requirements by the extended date.
Any unit that is granted an extension under this section shall not
be eligible for a waiver under section 111(j) of this Act, and shall
continue to be subject to requirements under this title as if it were
a unit subject to section 405.
(2) If (A) the owner or operator of an existing unit has been
granted an extension under paragraph (1) in order to repower such
unit with a clean coal unit, and (B) such owner or operator dem-
onstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the
repowering technology to be utilized by such unit has been properly
constructed and tested on such unit, but nevertheless has been un-
able to achieve the emission reduction limitations and is economi-
cally or technologically infeasible, such existing unit may be retro-
fitted or repowered with equipment or facilities utilizing another
clean coal technology or other available control technology.
(c) ALLOWANCES.—(1) For the period of the extension under
this section, the Administrator shall allocate to the owner or oper-
ator of the affected unit, annual allowances for sulfur dioxide equal
to the affected unit’s baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit’s
federally approved State Implementation Plan emissions limitation
or its actual emission rate for 1995 in lieu of any other allocation.
Such allowances may not be transferred or used by any other
source to meet emission requirements under this title. The source
owner or operator shall notify the Administrator sixty days in ad-

vance of the date on which the affected unit for which the exten-
sion has been granted is to be removed from operation to install
the repowering technology.
(2) Effective on that date, the unit shall be subject to the re-
quirements of section 405. Allowances for the year in which the
unit is removed from operation to install the repowering technology
shall be calculated as the product of the unit’s baseline multiplied
by 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000, and prorated accordingly, and
are transferable.
(3) Allowances for such existing utility units for calendar years
after the year the repowering is complete shall be calculated as the
product of the existing unit’s baseline multiplied by 1.20 lbs/
mmBtu, divided by 2,000.
(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 403 (a) and (e),
allowances shall be allocated under this section for a designated re-
placement unit which replaces an existing unit (as provided in the
last sentence of subsection (a)) in lieu of any further allocations of
allowances for the existing unit.
(5) For the purpose of meeting the aggregate emissions limita-
tion requirement set forth in section 403(a)(1), the units with an
extension under this subsection shall be treated in each calendar
year during the extension period as holding allowances allocated
under paragraph (3).
(d) CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.—Any unit qualifying for an ex-
tension under this section that does not increase actual hourly
emissions for any pollutant regulated under the 225 Act shall not be
subject to any standard of performance under section 111 of this
Act. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, no new unit
(1) designated as a replacement for an existing unit, (2) qualifying
for the extension under subsection (b), and (3) located at a different
site than the existing unit shall receive an exemption from the re-
quirements imposed under section 111.
(e) EXPEDITED PERMITTING.—State permitting authorities and,
where applicable, the Administrator, are encouraged to give expe-
dited consideration to permit applications under parts C and D of
title I of this Act for any source qualifying for an extension under
this section.
(f) PROHIBITION.—It shall be unlawful for the owner or oper-
ator of a repowered source to fail to comply with the requirement
of this section, or any regulations of permit requirements to imple-
ment this section, including the prohibition against emitting sulfur
dioxide in excess of allowances held.

ance with section 408. The Administrator shall approve a designa-
tion that meets the requirements of this section, and such des-
ignated unit, or source, shall be allocated allowances, and be an af-
fected unit for purposes of this title.
(b) ESTABLISHMENT OF BASELINE.—The baseline for a unit des-
ignated under this section shall be established by the Adminis-
trator by regulation, based on fuel consumption and operating data
for the unit for calendar years 1985, 1986, and 1987, or if such
data is not available, the Administrator may prescribe a baseline
based on alternative representative data.
(c) EMISSION LIMITATIONS.—Annual emissions limitations for
sulfur dioxide shall be equal to the product of the baseline multi-
plied by the lesser of the unit’s 1985 actual or allowable emission
rate in lbs/mmBtu, or, if the unit did not operate in 1985, by the
lesser of the unit’s actual or allowable emission rate for a calendar
year after 1985 (as determined by the Administrator), divided by
2,000.
(d) PROCESS SOURCES.—Not later than 18 months after enact-
ment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator
shall establish a program under which the owner or operator of a
process source that emits sulfur dioxide may elect to designate that
source as an affected unit for the purpose of receiving allowances
under this title. The Administrator shall, by regulation, define the
sources that may be designated; specify the emissions limitation;
specify the operating, emission baseline, and other data require-
ments; prescribe CEMS or other monitoring requirements; and pro-
mulgate permit, reporting, and any other requirements necessary
to implement such a program.
(e) A LLOWANCES AND PERMITS.—The Administrator shall issue
allowances to an affected unit under this section in an amount
equal to the emissions limitation calculated under subsection (c) or
(d), in accordance with section 403. Such allowance may be used in
accordance with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of section
403. Affected sources under this section shall be subject to the re-
quirements of sections 403, 408, 411, 412, 413, and 414.
(f) LIMITATION.—Any unit designated under this section shall
not transfer or bank allowances produced as a result of reduced
utilization or shutdown, except that, such allowances may be trans-
ferred or carried forward for use in subsequent years to the extent
that the reduced utilization or shutdown results from the replace-
ment of thermal energy from the unit designated under this sec-
tion, with thermal energy generated by any other unit or units sub-
ject to the requirements of this title, and the designated unit’s al-
lowances are transferred or carried forward for use at such other
replacement unit or units. In no case may the Administrator allo-
cate to a source designated under this section allowances in an
amount greater than the emissions resulting from operation of the
source in full compliance with the requirements of this Act. No
such allowances shall authorize operation of a unit in violation of
any other requirements of this Act.

(h) SMALL DIESEL REFINERIES.—The Administrator shall issue
allowances to owners or operators of small diesel refineries who
produce diesel fuel after October 1, 1993, meeting the requirements
of subsection 226 211(i) of this Act.
(1) ALLOWANCE PERIOD.—Allowances may be allocated
under this subsection only for the period from October 1, 1993,
through December 31, 1999.
(2) ALLOWANCE DETERMINATION.—The number of allow-
ances allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall equal the an-
nual number of pounds of sulfur dioxide reduction attributable
to desulfurization by a small refinery divided by 2,000. For the
purposes of this calculation, the concentration of sulfur re-
moved from diesel fuel shall be the difference between 0.274
percent (by weight) and 0.050 percent (by weight).
(3) REFINERY ELIGIBILITY.—As used in this subsection, the
term ‘‘small refinery’’ shall mean a refinery or portion of a re-
finery— (A) which, as of the date of enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990, has bona fide crude oil through-
put of less than 18,250,000 barrels per year, as reported
to the Department of Energy, and
(B) which, as of the date of enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990, is owned or controlled by a re-
finer with a total combined bona fide crude oil throughput
of less than 50,187,500 barrels per year, as reported to the
Department of Energy.
(4) LIMITATION PER REFINERY.—The maximum number of
allowances that can be annually allocated to a small refinery
pursuant to this subsection is one thousand and five hundred.
(5) LIMITATION ON TOTAL.—In any given year, the total
number of allowances allocated pursuant to this subsection

emissions were authorized pursuant to section 110(f). That penalty
shall be calculated on the basis of the number of tons emitted in
excess of the unit’s emissions limitation requirement or, in the case
of sulfur dioxide, of the allowances the operator holds for use for
the unit for that year, multiplied by $2,000. Any such penalty shall
be due and payable without demand to the Administrator as pro-
vided in regulations to be issued by the Administrator by no later
than eighteen months after the date of enactment of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990. Any such payment shall be deposited in
the United States Treasury pursuant to the Miscellaneous Receipts
Act. 229 Any penalty due and payable under this section shall not
diminish the liability of the unit’s owner or operator for any fine,
penalty or assessment against the unit for the same violation
under any other section of this Act.
(b) EXCESS EMISSIONS OFFSET.—The owner or operator of any
affected source that emits sulfur dioxide during any calendar year
in excess of the unit’s emissions limitation requirement or of the
allowances held for the unit for the calendar year, shall be liable
to offset the excess emissions by an equal tonnage amount in the
following calendar year, or such longer period as the Administrator
may prescribe. The owner or operator of the source shall, within
sixty days after the end of the year in which the excess emissions
occured, 230 submit to the Administrator, and to the State in which
the source is located, a proposed plan to achieve the required off-
sets. Upon approval of the proposed plan by the Administrator, as
submitted, modified or conditioned, the plan shall be deemed at a
condition of the operating permit for the unit without further re-
view or revision of the permit. The Administrator shall also deduct
allowances equal to the excess tonnage from those allocated for the
source for the calendar year, or succeeding years during which off-
sets are required, following the year in which the excess emissions
occurred.
(c) PENALTY ADJUSTMENT.—The Administrator shall, by regula-
tion, adjust the penalty specified in subsection (a) for inflation,
based on the Consumer Price Index, on the date of enactment and
annually thereafter.
(d) PROHIBITION.—It shall be unlawful for the owner or oper-
ator of any source liable for a penalty and offset under this section
to fail (1) to pay the penalty under subsection (a), (2) to provide,
and thereafter comply with, a compliance plan as required by sub-
section (b), or (3) to offset excess emissions as required by sub-
section (b).
(e) SAVINGS PROVISION.—Nothing in this title shall limit or
otherwise affect the application of section 113, 114, 120, or 304 ex-
cept as otherwise explicitly provided in this title.

each affected unit at the source, and to quality assure the data for
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, opacity and volumetric flow at each
such unit. The Administrator shall, by regulations issued not later
than eighteen months after enactment of the Clean Air Act Amend-
ments of 1990, specify the requirements for CEMS, for any alter-
native monitoring system that is demonstrated as providing infor-
mation with the same precision, reliability, accessibility, and time-
liness as that provided by CEMS, and for recordkeeping and re-
porting of information from such systems. Such regulations may in-
clude limitations or the use of alternative compliance methods by
units equipped with an alternative monitoring system as may be
necessary to preserve the orderly functioning of the allowance sys-
tem, and which will ensure the emissions reductions contemplated
by this title. Where 2 or more units utilize a single stack, a sepa-
rate CEMS shall not be required for each unit, and for such units
the regulations shall require that the owner or operator collect suf-
ficient information to permit reliable compliance determinations for
each such unit.
(b) FIRST PHASE REQUIREMENTS.—Not later than thirty-six
months after enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
the owner or operator of each affected unit under section 404, in-
cluding, but not limited to, units that become affected units pursu-
ant to subsections (b) and (c) and eligible units under subsection
(d), shall install and operate CEMS, quality assure the data, and
keep records and reports in accordance with the regulations issued
under subsection (a).
(c) SECOND PHASE REQUIREMENTS.—Not later than January 1,
1995, the owner or operator of each affected unit that has not pre-
viously met the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) shall install
and operate CEMS, quality assure the data, and keep records and
reports in accordance with the regulations issued under subsection
(a). Upon commencement of commercial operation of each new util-
ity unit, the unit shall comply with the requirements of subsection
(a).
(d) UNAVAILABILITY OF EMISSIONS DATA.—If CEMS data or
data from an alternative monitoring system approved by the Ad-
ministrator under subsection (a) is not available for any affected
unit during any period of a calendar year in which such data is re-
quired under this title, and the owner or operator cannot provide
information, satisfactory to the Administrator, on emissions during
that period, the Administrator shall deem the unit to be operating
in an uncontrolled manner during the entire period for which the
data was not available and shall, by regulation which shall be
issued not later than eighteen months after enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, prescribe means to calculate emis-
sions for that period. The owner or operator shall be liable for ex-
cess emissions fees and offsets under section 411 in accordance
with such regulations. Any fee due and payable under this sub-
section shall not diminish the liability of the unit’s owner or oper-
ator for any fine, penalty, fee or assessment against the unit for
the same violation under any other section of this Act.

installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a temporary or
permanent clean coal technology demonstration project. For
the purposes of this section, a clean coal technology demonstra-
tion project shall mean a project using funds appropriated
under the heading ‘‘Department of Energy—Clean Coal Tech-
nology’’, up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial
demonstration of clean coal technology, or similar projects
funded through appropriations for the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. The Federal contribution for a qualifying project
shall be at least 20 percent of the total cost of the demonstra-
tion project.
(2) TEMPORARY PROJECTS.—Installation, operation, ces-
sation, or removal of a temporary clean coal technology dem-
onstration project that is operated for a period of five years or
less, and which complies with the State implementation plans
for the State in which the project is located and other require-
ments necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient
air quality standards during and after the project is termi-

and D, such regulations or rulings shall apply to all areas in
which EPA is the permitting authority. In those instances in
which the State is the permitting authority under part C or D,
any State may adopt and submit to the Administrator for ap-
proval revisions to its implementation plan to apply the regula-
tions or rulings promulgated under this subsection.
(c) EXEMPTION FOR REACTIVATION OF VERY CLEAN UNITS.—
Physical changes or changes in the method of operation associated
with the commencement of commercial operations by a coal-fired
utility unit after a period of discontinued operation shall not sub-
ject the unit to the requirements of section 111 or part C of the Act
where the unit (1) has not been in operation for the two-year period
prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
and the emissions from such unit continue to be carried in the per-
mitting authority’s emissions inventory at the time of enactment,
(2) was equipped prior to shut-down with a continuous system of
emissions control that achieves a removal efficiency for sulfur diox-
ide of no less than 85 percent and a removal efficiency for particu-
lates of no less than 98 percent, (3) is equipped with low-NOx burn-
ers prior to the time of commencement, and (4) is otherwise in com-
pliance with the requirements of this Act.

SALE SUBACCOUNT UNDER THIS SECTION.—From the allowances
available in the Direct Sale Subaccount established under this
subsection, upon payment of the guaranteed price, the Admin-
istrator shall issue to any person exercising the right to pur-
chase allowances pursuant to a guarantee under this sub-
section the allowances covered by such guarantee. Persons to
which guarantees under this subsection have been issued shall
have the opportunity to purchase allowances pursuant to such
guarantee from such subaccount before the allowances in such
reserve are offered for sale to any other person.
(6) PROCEEDS.—Notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31 of
the United States Code or any other provision of law, the Ad-
ministrator shall require that the proceeds of any sale under
this subsection be transferred, within 90 days after the sale,
without charge, on a pro rata basis to the owners or operators
of the affected units from whom the allowances were withheld
under subsection (b) and that any unsold allowances be trans-
ferred to the Subaccount for Auction Sales established under
subsection (d). No proceeds of any sale under this subsection
shall be held by any officer or employee of the United States
or treated for any purpose as revenue to the United States or
to the Administrator.
(7) TERMINATION OF SUBACCOUNT.—If the Administrator
determines that, during any period of 2 consecutive calendar
years, less than 20 percent of the allowances available in the
subaccount for direct sales established under this subsection
have been purchased under this paragraph, the Administrator
shall terminate the subaccount and transfer such allowances to
the Auction Subaccount under subsection (d).

ceeds from the auction under this section, on a pro rata basis,
to the owners or operators of the affected units at an affected
source from whom allowances were withheld under subsection
(b). No funds transferred from a purchaser to a seller of allow-
ances under this paragraph shall be held by any officer or em-
ployee of the United States or treated for any purpose as rev-
enue to the United States or the Administrator.
(B) At the end of each year, any allowances offered for sale
but not sold at the auction shall be returned without charge,
on a pro rata basis, to the owner or operator of the affected
units from whose allocation the allowances were withheld.
(4) ADDITIONAL AUCTION PARTICIPANTS.—Any person hold-
ing allowances or to whom allowances are allocated by the Ad-
ministrator may submit those allowances to the Administrator
to be offered for sale at auction under this subsection. The pro-
ceeds of any such sale shall be transferred at the time of sale
by the purchaser to the person submitting such allowances for
sale. The holder of allowances offered for sale under this para-
graph may specify a minimum sale price. Any person may pur-
chase allowances offered for auction under this paragraph.
Such allowances shall be allocated and sold to purchasers on
the basis of bid price after the auction under paragraph (2) is
complete. No funds transferred from a purchaser to a seller of
allowances under this paragraph shall be held by any officer
or employee of the United States or treated for any purpose as
revenue to the United States or the Administrator.

and publicly report the nature, prices and results of each auc-
tion under this subsection, including the prices of successful
bids, and shall record the transfers of allowances as a result

spot auctions) decrease the number of allowances withheld and sold
under this section.
(f) TERMINATION OF AUCTIONS.—The Administrator may termi-
nate the withholding of allowances and the auction sales under this
section if the Administrator determines that, during any period of
3 consecutive calendar years after 2002, less than 20 percent of the
allowances available in the auction subaccount have been pur-
chased. Pursuant to regulations under this section, the Adminis-

forth the basis for such designation, except in compliance with a
permit issued by a permitting authority under this title. (Nothing
in this subsection shall be construed to alter the applicable require-
ments of this Act that a permit be obtained before construction or
modification.) The Administrator may, in the Administrator’s dis-
cretion and consistent with the applicable provisions of this Act,
promulgate regulations to exempt one or more source categories (in
whole or in part) from the requirements of this subsection if the
Administrator finds that compliance with such requirements is im-
practicable, infeasible, or unnecessarily burdensome on such cat-
egories, except that the Administrator may not exempt any major
source from such requirements.
(b) REGULATIONS.—The Administrator shall promulgate within
12 months after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 regulations establishing the minimum ele-
ments of a permit program to be administered by any air pollution
control agency. These elements shall include each of the following:
(1) Requirements for permit applications, including a

velop and administer the permit program requirements of this
title, including section 507, including the reasonable costs of—
(i) reviewing and acting upon any application for such
a permit,
(ii) if the owner or operator receives a permit for such
source, whether before or after the date of the enactment
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, implementing
and enforcing the terms and conditions of any such permit
(not including any court costs or other costs associated
with any enforcement action),
(iii) emissions and ambient monitoring,
(iv) preparing generally applicable regulations, or

program will result in the collection, in the aggregate,
from all sources subject to subparagraph (A), of an amount
not less than $25 per ton of each regulated pollutant, or
such other amount as the Administrator may determine
adequately reflects the reasonable costs of the permit pro-
gram.

(ii) As used in this subparagraph, the term ‘‘regulated
pollutant’’ shall mean (I) a volatile organic compound; (II)
each pollutant regulated under section 111 or 112; and
(III) each pollutant for which a national primary ambient
air quality standard has been promulgated (except that
carbon monoxide shall be excluded from this reference).
(iii) In determining the amount under clause (i), the
permitting authority is not required to include any amount
of regulated pollutant emitted by any source in excess of
4,000 tons per year of that regulated pollutant.
(iv) The requirements of clause (i) shall not apply if
the permitting authority demonstrates that collecting an
amount less than the amount specified under clause (i)
will meet the requirements of subparagraph (A).
(v) The fee calculated under clause (i) shall be in-
creased (consistent with the need to cover the reasonable
costs authorized by subparagraph (A)) in each year begin-
ning after the year of the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 by the percentage, if any, by which
the Consumer Price Index for the most recent calendar
year ending before the beginning of such year exceeds the
Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 1989. For pur-
poses of this clause—
(I) the Consumer Price Index for any calendar
year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for
all-urban consumers published by the Department of
Labor, as of the close of the 12-month period ending
on August 31 of each calendar year, and
(II) the revision of the Consumer Price Index
which is most consistent with the Consumer Price
Index for calendar year 1989 shall be used.
(C)(i) If the Administrator determines, under subsection
(d), that the fee provisions of the operating permit program do
not meet the requirements of this paragraph, or if the Admin-
istrator makes a determination, under subsection (i), that the
permitting authority is not adequately administering or enforc-
ing an approved fee program, the Administrator may, in addi-
tion to taking any other action authorized under this title, col-
lect reasonable fees from the sources identified under subpara-
graph (A). Such fees shall be designed solely to cover the Ad-
ministrator’s costs of administering the provisions of the per-
mit program promulgated by the Administrator.
(ii) Any source that fails to pay fees lawfully imposed by
the Administrator under this subparagraph shall pay a penalty
of 50 percent of the fee amount, plus interest on the fee
amount computed in accordance with section 6621(a)(2) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to computation of in-
terest on underpayment of Federal taxes).
(iii) Any fees, penalties, and interest collected under this
subparagraph shall be deposited in a special fund in the
United States Treasury for licensing and other services, which
thereafter shall be available for appropriation, to remain avail-
able until expended, subject to appropriation, to carry out the
Agency’s activities for which the fees were collected. Any fee

priate criminal penalties; and
(F) assure that no permit will be issued if the Admin-
istrator objects to its issuance in a timely manner under
this title.
(6) Adequate, streamlined, and reasonable procedures for
expeditiously determining when applications are complete, for
processing such applications, for public notice, including offer-
ing an opportunity for public comment and a hearing, and for
expeditious review of permit actions, including applications, re-
newals, or revisions, and including an opportunity for judicial
review in State court of the final permit action by the appli-
cant, any person who participated in the public comment proc-
ess, and any other person who could obtain judicial review of
that action under applicable law.
(7) To ensure against unreasonable delay by the permit-
ting authority, adequate authority and procedures to provide
that a failure of such permitting authority to act on a permit
application or permit renewal application (in accordance with
the time periods specified in section 503 or, as appropriate,
title IV) shall be treated as a final permit action solely for pur-
poses of obtaining judicial review in State court of an action
brought by any person referred to in paragraph (6) to require
that action be taken by the permitting authority on such appli-
cation without additional delay.

Administrator a permit program under State or local law or under
an interstate compact meeting the requirements of this title. In ad-
dition, the Governor shall submit a legal opinion from the attorney
general (or the attorney for those State air pollution control agen-
cies that have independent legal counsel), or from the chief legal
officer of an interstate agency, that the laws of the State, locality,
or the interstate compact provide adequate authority to carry out
the program. Not later than 1 year after receiving a program, and
after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Administrator
shall approve or disapprove such program, in whole or in part. The
Administrator may approve a program to the extent that the pro-
gram meets the requirements of this Act, including the regulations
issued under subsection (b). If the program is disapproved, in whole
or in part, the Administrator shall notify the Governor of any revi-
sions or modifications necessary to obtain approval. The Governor
shall revise and resubmit the program for review under this section
within 180 days after receiving notification.

under paragraph (1) or if the Administrator disapproves a program
submitted by the Governor under paragraph (1), in whole or in

under paragraph (1), or if the Administrator disapproves any such
program submitted by the Governor under paragraph (1), in whole
or in part, 18 months after the date required for such submittal or
the date of such disapproval, as the case may be, the Administrator
shall apply sanctions under section 179(b) in the same manner and
subject to the same deadlines and other conditions as are applica-
ble in the case of a determination, disapproval, or finding under
section 179(a).
(C) The sanctions under section 179(b)(2) shall not apply pur-
suant to this paragraph in any area unless the failure to submit
or the disapproval referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) relates to
an air pollutant for which such area has been designated a non-
attainment area (as defined in part D of title I).
(3) If a program meeting the requirements of this title has not
been approved in whole for any State, the Administrator shall, 2
years after the date required for submission of such a program
under paragraph (1), promulgate, administer, and enforce a pro-
gram under this title for that State.
(e) SUSPENSION.—The Administrator shall suspend the
issuance of permits promptly upon publication of notice of approval
of a permit program under this section, but may, in such notice,
retain jurisdiction over permits that have been federally issued, but
for which the administrative or judicial review process is not com-
plete. The Administrator shall continue to administer and enforce
federally issued permits under this title until they are replaced by
a permit issued by a permitting program. Nothing in this sub-
section should be construed to limit the Administrator’s ability to
enforce permits issued by a State.
(f) PROHIBITION.—No partial permit program shall be approved
unless, at a minimum, it applies, and ensures compliance with, this
title and each of the following:
(1) All requirements established under title IV applicable
to ‘‘affected sources’’.
(2) All requirements established under section 112 applica-
ble to ‘‘major sources’’, ‘‘area sources,’’ and ‘‘new sources’’.
(3) All requirements of title I (other than section 112) ap-
plicable to sources required to have a permit under this title.
Approval of a partial program shall not relieve the State of its obli-
gation to submit a complete program, nor from the application of
any sanctions under this Act for failure to submit an approvable
permit program.
(g) INTERIM APPROVAL.—If a program (including a partial per-
mit program) submitted under this title substantially meets the re-
quirements of this title, but is not fully approvable, the Adminis-
trator may by rule grant the program interim approval. In the no-
tice of final rulemaking, the Administrator shall specify the
changes that must be made before the program can receive full ap-
proval. An interim approval under this subsection shall expire on
a date set by the Administrator not later than 2 years after such
approval, and may not be renewed. For the period of any such in-
terim approval, the provisions of subsection (d)(2), and the obliga-
tion of the Administrator to promulgate a program under this title
for the State pursuant to subsection (d)(3), shall be suspended.

ministrator makes a determination that a permitting authority is
not adequately administering and enforcing a program, or portion
thereof, in accordance with the requirements of this title, the Ad-
ministrator shall provide notice to the State and may, prior to the
expiration of the 18-month period referred to in paragraph (2), in
the Administrator’s discretion, apply any of the sanctions specified
in section 179(b).
(2) Whenever the Administrator makes a determination that a
permitting authority is not adequately administering and enforcing
a program, or portion thereof, in accordance with the requirements
of this title, 18 months after the date of the notice under paragraph
(1), the Administrator shall apply the sanctions under section
179(b) in the same manner and subject to the same deadlines and
other conditions as are applicable in the case of a determination,
disapproval, or finding under section 179(a).
(3) The sanctions under section 179(b)(2) shall not apply pursu-
ant to this subsection in any area unless the failure to adequately
enforce and administer the program relates to an air pollutant for
which such area has been designated a nonattainment area.
(4) Whenever the Administrator has made a finding under
paragraph (1) with respect to any State, unless the State has cor-
rected such deficiency within 18 months after the date of such find-
ing, the Administrator shall, 2 years after the date of such finding,
promulgate, administer, and enforce a program under this title for
that State. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect
the validity of a program which has been approved under this title
or the authority of any permitting authority acting under such pro-
gram until such time as such program is promulgated by the Ad-
ministrator under this paragraph.

mit, and to promptly report any deviations from permit require-
ments to the permitting authority.
(c) DEADLINE.—Any person required to have a permit shall, not
later than 12 months after the date on which the source becomes
subject to a permit program approved or promulgated under this
title, or such earlier date as the permitting authority may estab-
lish, submit to the permitting authority a compliance plan and an
application for a permit signed by a responsible official, who shall
certify the accuracy of the information submitted. The permitting
authority shall approve or disapprove a completed application (con-
sistent with the procedures established under this title for consid-
eration of such applications), and shall issue or deny the permit,
within 18 months after the date of receipt thereof, except that the
permitting authority shall establish a phased schedule for acting
on permit applications submitted within the first full year after the
effective date of a permit program (or a partial or interim pro-
gram). Any such schedule shall assure that at least one-third of
such permits will be acted on by such authority annually over a pe-
riod of not to exceed 3 years after such effective date. Such author-
ity shall establish reasonable procedures to prioritize such approval
or disapproval actions in the case of applications for construction

required to have a permit before construction or modification under
the applicable requirements of this Act, if an applicant has sub-
mitted a timely and complete application for a permit required by
this title (including renewals), but final action has not been taken
on such application, the source’s failure to have a permit shall not
be a violation of this Act, unless the delay in final action was due
to the failure of the applicant timely to submit information re-
quired or requested to process the application. No source required
to have a permit under this title shall be in violation of section
502(a) before the date on which the source is required to submit
an application under subsection (c).

any required monitoring, and such other conditions as are nec-
essary to assure compliance with applicable requirements of this
Act, including the requirements of the applicable implementation
plan.
(b) MONITORING AND ANALYSIS.—The Administrator may by
rule prescribe procedures and methods for determining compliance
and for monitoring and analysis of pollutants regulated under this
Act, but continuous emissions monitoring need not be required if
alternative methods are available that provide sufficiently reliable
and timely information for determining compliance. Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to affect any continuous emissions
monitoring requirement of title IV, or where required elsewhere in
this Act.
(c) INSPECTION, ENTRY, MONITORING, CERTIFICATION, AND RE-
PORTING.—Each permit issued under this title shall set forth in-
spection, entry, monitoring, compliance certification, and reporting
requirements to assure compliance with the permit terms and con-
ditions. Such monitoring and reporting requirements shall conform
to any applicable regulation under subsection (b). Any report re-
quired to be submitted by a permit issued to a corporation under
this title shall be signed by a responsible corporate official, who
shall certify its accuracy.
(d) GENERAL PERMITS.—The permitting authority may, after
notice and opportunity for public hearing, issue a general permit
covering numerous similar sources. Any general permit shall com-
ply with all requirements applicable to permits under this title. No
source covered by a general permit shall thereby be relieved from
the obligation to file an application under section 503.
(e) T EMPORARY SOURCES.—The permitting authority may issue
a single permit authorizing emissions from similar operations at
multiple temporary locations. No such permit shall be issued un-
less it includes conditions that will assure compliance with all the
requirements of this Act at all authorized locations, including, but
not limited to, ambient standards and compliance with any applica-
ble increment or visibility requirements under part C of title I. Any
such permit shall in addition require the owner or operator to no-
tify the permitting authority in advance of each change in location.
The permitting authority may require a separate permit fee for op-
erations at each location.
(f) PERMIT SHIELD.—Compliance with a permit issued in ac-
cordance with this title shall be deemed compliance with section
502. Except as otherwise provided by the Administrator by rule,
the permit may also provide that compliance with the permit shall
be deemed compliance with other applicable provisions of this Act
that relate to the permittee if—
(1) the permit includes the applicable requirements of such
provisions, or
(2) the permitting authority in acting on the permit appli-
cation makes a determination relating to the permittee that
such other provisions (which shall be referred to in such deter-
mination) are not applicable and the permit includes the deter-
mination or a concise summary thereof.

STATES.
(a) TRANSMISSION AND NOTICE.—(1) Each permitting author-
ity— (A) shall transmit to the Administrator a copy of each per-
mit application (and any application for a permit modification
or renewal) or such portion thereof, including any compliance
plan, as the Administrator may require to effectively review
the application and otherwise to carry out the Administrator’s
responsibilities under this Act, and
(B) shall provide to the Administrator a copy of each per-
mit proposed to be issued and issued as a final permit.
(2) The permitting authority shall notify all States—
(A) whose air quality may be affected and that are contig-
uous to the State in which the emission originates, or
(B) that are within 50 miles of the source,
of each permit application or proposed permit forwarded to the Ad-
ministrator under this section, and shall provide an opportunity for
such States to submit written recommendations respecting the
issuance of the permit and its terms and conditions. If any part of
those recommendations are not accepted by the permitting author-
ity, such authority shall notify the State submitting the rec-
ommendations and the Administrator in writing of its failure to ac-
cept those recommendations and the reasons therefor.
(b) OBJECTION BY EPA.—(1) If any permit contains provisions
that are determined by the Administrator as not in compliance
with the applicable requirements of this Act, including the require-
ments of an applicable implementation plan, the Administrator
shall, in accordance with this subsection, object to its issuance. The
permitting authority shall respond in writing if the Administrator
(A) within 45 days after receiving a copy of the proposed permit
under subsection (a)(1), or (B) within 45 days after receiving notifi-
cation under subsection (a)(2), objects in writing to its issuance as
not in compliance with such requirements. With the objection, the
Administrator shall provide a statement of the reasons for the ob-
jection. A copy of the objection and statement shall be provided to
the applicant.
(2) If the Administrator does not object in writing to the
issuance of a permit pursuant to paragraph (1), any person may pe-
tition the Administrator within 60 days after the expiration of the
45-day review period specified in paragraph (1) to take such action.
A copy of such petition shall be provided to the permitting author-
ity and the applicant by the petitioner. The petition shall be based
only on objections to the permit that were raised with reasonable
specificity during the public comment period provided by the per-
mitting agency (unless the petitioner demonstrates in the petition
to the Administrator that it was impracticable to raise such objec-
tions within such period or unless the grounds for such objection
arose after such period). The petition shall identify all such objec-

tions. If the permit has been issued by the permitting agency, such
petition shall not postpone the effectiveness of the permit. The Ad-
ministrator shall grant or deny such petition within 60 days after
the petition is filed. The Administrator shall issue an objection
within such period if the petitioner demonstrates to the Adminis-
trator that the permit is not in compliance with the requirements
of this Act, including the requirements of the applicable implemen-
tation plan. Any denial of such petition shall be subject to judicial
review under section 307. The Administrator shall include in regu-
lations under this title provisions to implement this paragraph.
The Administrator may not delegate the requirements of this para-
graph.
(3) Upon receipt of an objection by the Administrator under
this subsection, the permitting authority may not issue the permit
unless it is revised and issued in accordance with subsection (c). If
the permitting authority has issued a permit prior to receipt of an
objection by the Administrator under paragraph (2) of this sub-
section, the Administrator shall modify, terminate, or revoke such
permit and the permitting authority may thereafter only issue a re-
vised permit in accordance with subsection (c).
(c) ISSUANCE OR DENIAL.—If the permitting authority fails,
within 90 days after the date of an objection under subsection (b),
to submit a permit revised to meet the objection, the Administrator
shall issue or deny the permit in accordance with the requirements
of this title. No objection shall be subject to judicial review until
the Administrator takes final action to issue or deny a permit
under this subsection.
(d) WAIVER OF NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.—(1) The Admin-
istrator may waive the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) at
the time of approval of a permit program under this title for any
category (including any class, type, or size within such category) of
sources covered by the program other than major sources.
(2) The Administrator may, by regulation, establish categories
of sources (including any class, type, or size within such category)
to which the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) shall not
apply. The preceding sentence shall not apply to major sources.
(3) The Administrator may exclude from any waiver under this
subsection notification under subsection (a)(2). Any waiver granted
under this subsection may be revoked or modified by the Adminis-
trator by rule.
(e) REFUSAL OF PERMITTING AUTHORITY TO TERMINATE, MOD-
IFY, OR REVOKE AND REISSUE.—If the Administrator finds that
cause exists to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue a permit
under this title, the Administrator shall notify the permitting au-
thority and the source of the Administrator’s finding. The permit-
ting authority shall, within 90 days after receipt of such notifica-
tion, forward to the Administrator under this section a proposed
determination of termination, modification, or revocation and
reissuance, as appropriate. The Administrator may extend such 90
day period for an additional 90 days if the Administrator finds that
a new or revised permit application is necessary, or that the per-
mitting authority must require the permittee to submit additional
information. The Administrator may review such proposed deter-
mination under the provisions of subsections (a) and (b). If the per-

of the substances listed above. Pursuant to subsection (c), the Ad-
ministrator shall add to the list of class II substances any other
substance that the Administrator finds is known or may reasonably
be anticipated to cause or contribute to harmful effects on the
stratospheric ozone layer.
(c) ADDITIONS TO THE LISTS.—(1) The Administrator may add,
by rule, in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (a)
or (b), as the case may be, any substance to the list of class I or
class II substances under subsection (a) or (b). For purposes of ex-
changes under section 507, 237 whenever a substance is added to
the list of class I substances the Administrator shall, to the extent
consistent with the Montreal Protocol, assign such substance to ex-
isting Group I, II, III, IV, or V or place such substance in a new
Group.
(2) Periodically, but not less frequently than every 3 years
after the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the
Administrator shall list, by rule, as additional class I or class II
substances those substances which the Administrator finds meet
the criteria of subsection (a) or (b), as the case may be.
(3) At any time, any person may petition the Administrator to
add a substance to the list of class I or class II substances. Pursu-
ant to the criteria set forth in subsection (a) or (b) as the case may
be, within 180 days after receiving such a petition, the Adminis-
trator shall either propose to add the substance to such list or pub-
lish an explanation of the petition denial. In any case where the
Administrator proposes to add a substance to such list, the Admin-
istrator shall add, by rule, (or make a final determination not to
add) such substance to such list within 1 year after receiving such
petition. Any petition under this paragraph shall include a showing
by the petitioner that there are data on the substance adequate to
support the petition. If the Administrator determines that informa-
tion on the substance is not sufficient to make a determination
under this paragraph, the Administrator shall use any authority
available to the Administrator, under any law administered by the
Administrator, to acquire such information.
(4) Only a class II substance which is added to the list of class
I substances may be removed from the list of class II substances.

if such schedule or deadline is unattainable, considering when such
substance is added to the list. No extension under this subsection
may extend the date for termination of production of any class I
substance to a date more than 7 years after January 1 of the year
after the year in which the substance is added to the list of class
I substances. No extension under this subsection may extend the
date for termination of production of any class II substance to a
date more than 10 years after January 1 of the year after the year
in which the substance is added to the list of class II substances.
(e) OZONE-DEPLETION AND GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL.—Si-
multaneously with publication of the lists under this section and si-
multaneously with any addition to either of such lists, the Adminis-
trator shall assign to each listed substance a numerical value rep-
resenting the substance’s ozone-depletion potential. In addition, the
Administrator shall publish the chlorine and bromine loading po-
tential and the atmospheric lifetime of each listed substance. One
year after enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(one year after the addition of a substance to either of such lists
in the case of a substance added after the publication of the initial
lists of such substances), and after notice and opportunity for pub-
lic comment, the Administrator shall publish the global warming
potential of each listed substance. The preceding sentence shall not
be construed to be the basis of any additional regulation under this
Act. In the case of the substances referred to in table 1, the ozone-
depletion potential shall be as specified in table 1, unless the Ad-
ministrator adjusts the substance’s ozone-depletion potential based
on criteria referred to in section 601(10):

SEC. 603. MONITORING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
(a) REGULATIONS.—Within 270 days after the enactment of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall amend
the regulations of the Administrator in effect on such date regard-
ing monitoring and reporting of class I and class II substances.
Such amendments shall conform to the requirements of this sec-
tion. The amended regulations shall include requirements with re-
spect to the time and manner of monitoring and reporting as re-
quired under this section.
(b) PRODUCTION, IMPORT, AND EXPORT LEVEL REPORTS.—On a
quarterly basis, or such other basis (not less than annually) as de-
termined by the Administrator, each person who produced, im-
ported, or exported a class I or class II substance shall file a report
with the Administrator setting forth the amount of the substance
that such person produced, imported, and exported during the pre-
ceding reporting period. Each such report shall be signed and at-
tested by a responsible officer. No such report shall be required
from a person after April 1 of the calendar year after such person
permanently ceases production, importation, and exportation of the
substance and so notifies the Administrator in writing.
(c) BASELINE REPORTS FOR CLASS I SUBSTANCES.—Unless such
information has previously been reported to the Administrator, on
the date on which the first report under subsection (b) is required
to be filed, each person who produced, imported, or exported a class
I substance (other than a substance added to the list of class I sub-
stances after the publication of the initial list of such substances
under this section) shall file a report with the Administrator set-
ting forth the amount of such substance that such person produced,
imported, and exported during the baseline year. In the case of a
substance added to the list of class I substances after publication
of the initial list of such substances under this section, the regula-
tions shall require that each person who produced, imported, or ex-
ported such substance shall file a report with the Administrator
within 180 days after the date on which such substance is added
to the list, setting forth the amount of the substance that such per-
son produced, imported, and exported in the baseline year.
(d) MONITORING AND REPORTS TO CONGRESS.—(1) The Adminis-
trator shall monitor and, not less often than every 3 years following
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, submit a re-
port to Congress on the production, use and consumption of class
I and class II substances. Such report shall include data on domes-
tic production, use and consumption, and an estimate of worldwide
production, use and consumption of such substances. Not less fre-
quently than every 6 years the Administrator shall report to Con-
gress on the environmental and economic effects of any strato-
spheric ozone depletion.

istration shall monitor, and not less often than every 3 years fol-
lowing enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, sub-
mit a report to Congress on the current average tropospheric con-
centration of chlorine and bromine and on the level of stratospheric
ozone depletion. Such reports shall include updated projections of—
(A) peak chlorine loading;
(B) the rate at which the atmospheric abundance of chlo-
rine is projected to decrease after the year 2000; and
(C) the date by which the atmospheric abundance of chlo-
rine is projected to return to a level of two parts per billion.
Such updated projections shall be made on the basis of current
international and domestic controls on substances covered by this
title as well as on the basis of such controls supplemented by a
year 2000 global phase out of all halocarbon emissions (the base
case). It is the purpose of the Congress through the provisions of
this section to monitor closely the production and consumption of
class II substances to assure that the production and consumption
of such substances will not:
(i) increase significantly the peak chlorine loading that is
projected to occur under the base case established for purposes
of this section;
(ii) reduce significantly the rate at which the atmospheric
abundance of chlorine is projected to decrease under the base
case; or
(iii) delay the date by which the average atmospheric con-
centration of chlorine is projected under the base case to return
to a level of two parts per billion.
(e) TECHNOLOGY STATUS REPORT IN 2015.—The Administrator
shall review, on a periodic basis, the progress being made in the
development of alternative systems or products necessary to manu-
facture and operate appliances without class II substances. If the
Administrator finds, after notice and opportunity for public com-
ment, that as a result of technological development problems, the
development of such alternative systems or products will not occur
within the time necessary to provide for the manufacture of such
equipment without such substances prior to the applicable dead-
lines under section 605, the Administrator shall, not later than
January 1, 2015, so inform the Congress.
(f) E MERGENCY REPORT.—If, in consultation with the Adminis-
trators of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and after
notice and opportunity for public comment, the Administrator de-
termines that the global production, consumption, and use of class
II substances are projected to contribute to an atmospheric chlorine
loading in excess of the base case projections by more than 5 ⁄10 ths
parts per billion, the Administrator shall so inform the Congress
immediately. The determination referred to in the preceding sen-
tence shall be based on the monitoring under subsection (d) and
updated not less often than every 3 years.

(c) REGULATIONS REGARDING PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
OF CLASS I SUBSTANCES.—The Administrator shall promulgate reg-
ulations within 10 months after the enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 phasing out the production of class I sub-
stances in accordance with this section and other applicable provi-
sions of this title. The Administrator shall also promulgate regula-
tions to insure that the consumption of class I substances in the
United States is phased out and terminated in accordance with the
same schedule (subject to the same exceptions and other provi-
sions) as is applicable to the phase-out and termination of produc-
tion of class I substances under this title.

that permits production after December 31, 1999.
(2) The Administrator shall periodically monitor and assess the
status of efforts to obtain substitutes for the substances referred to
in paragraph (1) for purposes of fire suppression or explosion pre-
vention and the probability of such substitutes being available by
December 31, 1999. The Administrator, as part of such assessment,
shall consider any relevant assessments under the Montreal Pro-
tocol and the actions of the Parties pursuant to Article 2B of the
Montreal Protocol in identifying essential uses and in permitting a
level of production or consumption that is necessary to satisfy such
uses for which no adequate alternatives are available after Decem-
ber 31, 1999. The Administrator shall report to Congress the re-
sults of such assessment in 1994 and again in 1998.
(3) Notwithstanding the termination of production set forth in
subsection (b), the Administrator, after notice and opportunity for
public comment, may, to the extent consistent with the Montreal
Protocol, authorize the production of limited quantities of halon-
1211, halon-1301, and halon-2402 in the period after December 31,
1999, and before December 31, 2004, solely for purposes of fire sup-
pression or explosion prevention in association with domestic pro-
duction of crude oil and natural gas energy supplies on the North
Slope of Alaska, if the Administrator, in consultation with the Ad-
ministrator of the United States Fire Administration, determines
that no safe and effective substitute has been developed and that
such authorization is necessary for fire suppression and explosion
prevention purposes. The Administrator shall not authorize produc-
tion under the paragraph for purposes of fire safety or explosion
prevention training or testing of fire suppression or explosion pre-
vention equipment. In no event shall the Administrator authorize
under this paragraph any person to produce any such halon in an
amount greater than 3 percent of that produced by such person
during the baseline year.
(h) METHYL BROMIDE.—Notwithstanding subsection (d) and
section 604(b), the Administrator shall not terminate production of
methyl bromide prior to January 1, 2005. The Administrator shall
promulgate rules for reductions in, and terminate the production,
importation, and consumption of, methyl bromide under a schedule
that is in accordance with, but not more stringent than, the phase-
out schedule of the Montreal Protocol Treaty as in effect on the
date of the enactment of this subsection.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall promulgate regula-
tions, after notice and opportunity for public comment, which es-
tablish a schedule for phasing out the production and consumption
of class I and class II substances (or use of class II substances) that
is more stringent than set forth in section 604 or 605, or both, if—
(1) based on an assessment of credible current scientific in-
formation (including any assessment under the Montreal Pro-
tocol) regarding harmful effects on the stratospheric ozone
layer associated with a class I or class II substance, the Ad-
ministrator determines that such more stringent schedule may
be necessary to protect human health and the environment
against such effects,
(2) based on the availability of substitutes for listed sub-
stances, the Administrator determines that such more strin-
gent schedule is practicable, taking into account technological
achievability, safety, and other relevant factors, or
(3) the Montreal Protocol is modified to include a schedule
to control or reduce production, consumption, or use of any
substance more rapidly than the applicable schedule under this
title.
In making any determination under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Ad-
ministrator shall consider the status of the period remaining under
the applicable schedule under this title.
(b) PETITION.—Any person may petition the Administrator to
promulgate regulations under this section. The Administrator shall
grant or deny the petition within 180 days after receipt of any such
petition. If the Administrator denies the petition, the Adminis-
trator shall publish an explanation of why the petition was denied.
If the Administrator grants such petition, such final regulations
shall be promulgated within 1 year. Any petition under this sub-
section shall include a showing by the petitioner that there are
data adequate to support the petition. If the Administrator deter-
mines that information is not sufficient to make a determination

(a) TRANSFERS.—The Administrator shall, within 10 months
after the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, pro-
mulgate rules under this title providing for the issuance of allow-
ances for the production of class I and II substances in accordance
with the requirements of this title and governing the transfer of
such allowances. Such rules shall insure that the transactions
under the authority of this section will result in greater total re-
ductions in the production in each year of class I and class II sub-
stances than would occur in that year in the absence of such trans-
actions.
(b) INTERPOLLUTANT TRANSFERS.—(1) The rules under this sec-
tion shall permit a production allowance for a substance for any
year to be transferred for a production allowance for another sub-
stance for the same year on an ozone depletion weighted basis.
(2) Allowances for substances in each group of class I sub-
stances (as listed pursuant to section 602) may only be transferred
for allowances for other substances in the same Group.
(3) The Administrator shall, as appropriate, establish groups of
class II substances for trading purposes and assign class II sub-
stances to such groups. In the case of class II substances, allow-
ances may only be transferred for allowances for other class II sub-
stances that are in the same Group.
(c) TRADES WITH OTHER PERSONS.—The rules under this sec-
tion shall permit 2 or more persons to transfer production allow-
ances (including interpollutant transfers which meet the require-
ments of subsections (a) and (b)) if the transferor of such allow-
ances will be subject, under such rules, to an enforceable and quan-
tifiable reduction in annual production which—
(1) exceeds the reduction otherwise applicable to the trans-
feror under this title,
(2) exceeds the production allowances transferred to the
transferee, and
(3) would not have occurred in the absence of such trans-
action.
(d) CONSUMPTION.—The rules under this section shall also pro-
vide for the issuance of consumption allowances in accordance with
the requirements of this title and for the trading of such allow-
ances in the same manner as is applicable under this section to the
trading of production allowances under this section.

including the use and disposal of class II substances during service,
repair, or disposal of appliances and industrial process refrigera-
tion. Such standards and requirements shall become effective not
later than 12 months after promulgation of the regulations.
(3) The regulations under this subsection shall include require-
ments that—
(A) reduce the use and emission of such substances to the
lowest achievable level, and
(B) maximize the recapture and recycling of such sub-
stances.
Such regulations may include requirements to use alternative sub-
stances (including substances which are not class I or class II sub-
stances) or to minimize use of class I or class II substances, or to
promote the use of safe alternatives pursuant to section 612 or any
combination of the foregoing.
(b) SAFE DISPOSAL.—The regulations under subsection (a) shall
establish standards and requirements for the safe disposal of class
I and II substances. Such regulations shall include each of the fol-
lowing—
(1) Requirements that class I or class II substances con-
tained in bulk in appliances, machines or other goods shall be
removed from each such appliance, machine or other good prior
to the disposal of such items or their delivery for recycling.

stance during service and repair or disposal of such item.
(3) Requirements that any product in which a class I or
class II substance is incorporated so as to constitute an inher-
ent element of such product shall be disposed of in a manner
that reduces, to the maximum extent practicable, the release
of such substance into the environment. If the Administrator
determines that the application of this paragraph to any prod-
uct would result in producing only insignificant environmental
benefits, the Administrator shall include in such regulations an
exception for such product.
(c) PROHIBITIONS.—(1) Effective July 1, 1992, it shall be unlaw-
ful for any person, in the course of maintaining, servicing, repair-
ing, or disposing of an appliance or industrial process refrigeration,
to knowingly vent or otherwise knowingly release or dispose of any
class I or class II substance used as a refrigerant in such appliance

ministration, Federal procurement practices with respect to
class I and class II substances and recommend measures to
promote the transition by the Federal Government, as expedi-
tiously as possible, to the use of safe substitutes;
(3) specify initiatives, including appropriate intergovern-
mental, international, and commercial information and tech-
nology transfers, to promote the development and use of safe
substitutes for class I and class II substances, including alter-
native chemicals, product substitutes, and alternative manu-
facturing processes; and
