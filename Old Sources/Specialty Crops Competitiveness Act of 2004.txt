Public Law 108–465
108th Congress
An Act
To ensure an abundant and affordable supply of highly nutritious fruits, vegetables,
and other specialty crops for American consumers and international markets
by enhancing the competitiveness of United States-grown specialty crops, and
for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Specialty Crops Competitiveness
Act of 2004’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
(1) A secure domestic food supply is a national security
imperative for the United States.
(2) A competitive specialty crop industry in the United
States is necessary for the production of an abundant, afford-
able supply of highly nutritious fruits, vegetables, and other
specialty crops, which are vital to the health and well-being
of all Americans.
(3) Increased consumption of specialty crops will provide
tremendous health and economic benefits to both consumers
and specialty crop growers.
(4) Specialty crop growers believe that there are numerous
areas of Federal agriculture policy that could be improved
to promote increased consumption of specialty crops and
increase the competitiveness of producers in the efficient
production of affordable specialty crops in the United States.
(5) As the globalization of markets continues, it is becoming
increasingly difficult for United States producers to compete
against heavily subsidized foreign producers in both the
domestic and foreign markets.
(6) United States specialty crop producers also continue
to face serious tariff and non-tariff trade barriers in many
export markets.
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to make necessary
changes in Federal agriculture policy to accomplish the goals of
increasing fruit, vegetable, and nut consumption and improving
the competitiveness of United States specialty crop producers.

(e); (2) an assurance that the State will comply with the
