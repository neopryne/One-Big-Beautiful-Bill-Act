TITLE I—REGULATION OF SECURITIES EXCHANGES
SHORT TITLE
SECTION 1. ø78a¿ This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934’’.
NECESSITY FOR REGULATION AS PROVIDED IN THIS TITLE
S EC. 2. ø78b¿ For the reasons hereinafter enumerated, trans-
actions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities ex-
changes and over-the-counter markets are affected with a national
public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulation
and control of such transactions and of practices and matters re-
lated thereto, including transactions by officers, directors, and prin-
cipal security holders, to require appropriate reports, to remove im-
pediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a national market sys-
tem for securities and a national system for the clearance and set-
tlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities
and funds related thereto, and to impose requirements necessary to
make such regulation and control reasonably complete and effec-
tive, in order to protect interstate commerce, the national credit,
the Federal taxing power, to protect and make more effective the
national banking system and Federal Reserve System, and to in-
sure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such trans-
actions:

1 So in law. Should be ‘‘effected’’.
Section 985(b)(1) of Public Law 111–203 provides for an amendment to section 2 by striking
‘‘affected’’ and inserting ‘‘effected’’. Such amendment was not executed because the word ‘‘af-
fected’’ appears more than one time in section 2 and it did not specify to which occurrence of
such word to strike.
(1) Such transactions (a) are carried on in large volume by the
public generally and in large part originate outside the States in
which the exchanges and over-the-counter markets are located and/
or are affected 1 by means of the mails and instrumentalities of
interstate commerce; (b) constitute an important part of the cur-
rent of interstate commerce; (c) involve in large part the securities
of issuers engaged in interstate commerce; (d) involve the use of
credit, directly affect the financing of trade, industry, and transpor-
tation in interstate commerce, and directly affect and influence the
volume of interstate commerce; and affect the national credit.
(2) The prices established and offered in such transactions are
generally disseminated and quoted throughout the United States
and foreign countries and constitute a basis for determining and
establishing the prices at which securities are bought and sold, the
amount of certain taxes owing to the United States and to the sev-
eral States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and the
value of collateral for bank loans.
(3) Frequently the prices of securities on such exchanges and
markets are susceptible to manipulation and control, and the dis-
semination of such prices gives rise to excessive speculation, result-
ing in sudden and unreasonable fluctuations in the prices of securi-
ties which (a) cause alternately unreasonable expansion and unrea-
sonable contraction of the volume of credit available for trade,
transportation, and industry in interstate commerce, (b) hinder the
proper appraisal of the value of securities and thus prevent a fair
calculation of taxes owing to the United States and to the several
States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and (c) prevent
the fair valuation of collateral for bank loans and/or obstruct the
effective operation of the national banking system and Federal Re-
serve System.
(4) National emergencies, which produce widespread unemploy-
ment and the dislocation of trade, transportation, and industry,
and which burden interstate commerce and adversely affect the
general welfare, are precipitated, intensified, and prolonged by ma-
nipulation and sudden and unreasonable fluctuations of security
prices and by excessive speculation on such exchanges and mar-
kets, and to meet such emergencies the Federal Government is put
to such great expense as to burden the national credit.

tigation is sufficiently complex such that a determination re-
garding the filing of an action against a person cannot be com-
pleted within the additional 180-day period, the Director of the
Division of Enforcement of the Commission or the Director’s

(b) COMPLIANCE EXAMINATIONS AND INSPECTIONS.—
(1) I N GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the date on
which Commission staff completes the on-site portion of its
compliance examination or inspection or receives all records re-
quested from the entity being examined or inspected, which-
ever is later, Commission staff shall provide the entity being
examined or inspected with written notification indicating ei-
ther that the examination or inspection has concluded, has con-
cluded without findings, or that the staff requests the entity
undertake corrective action.
(2) EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN COMPLEX ACTIONS.—Notwith-
standing paragraph (1), if the head of any division or office
within the Commission responsible for compliance examina-
tions and inspections or his designee determines that a par-
ticular compliance examination or inspection is sufficiently
complex such that a determination regarding concluding the
examination or inspection, or regarding the staff requests the
entity undertake corrective action, cannot be completed within
the deadline specified in paragraph (1), the head of any divi-
sion or office within the Commission responsible for compliance
examinations and inspections or his designee may, after pro-
viding notice to the Chairman of the Commission, extend such
deadline as needed for one additional 180-day period.
TRANSACTIONS ON UNREGISTERED EXCHANGES
S EC. 5. ø78e¿ It shall be unlawful for any broker, dealer, or ex-
change, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce for the purpose of
using any facility of an exchange within or subject to the jurisdic-
tion of the United States to effect any transaction in a security, or
to report any such transaction, unless such exchange (1) is reg-
istered as a national securities exchange under section 6 of this
title, or (2) is exempted from such registration upon application by
the exchange because, in the opinion of the Commission, by reason
of the limited volume of transactions effected on such exchange, it
is not practicable and not necessary or appropriate in the public in-
terest or for the protection of investors to require such registration.
NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES
S EC. 6. ø78f¿ (a) An exchange may be registered as a national
securities exchange under the terms and conditions hereinafter

mation and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe
as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protec-
tion of investors.
(b) An exchange shall not be registered as a national securities
exchange unless the Commission determines that—
(1) Such exchange is so organized and has the capacity to
be able to carry out the purposes of this title and to comply,
and (subject to any rule or order of the Commission pursuant
to section 17(d) or 19(g)(2) of this title) to enforce compliance
by its members and persons associated with its members, with
the provisions of this title, the rules and regulations there-
under, and the rules of the exchange.
(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this sec-
tion, the rules of the exchange provide that any registered
broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered
broker or dealer may become a member of such exchange and
any person may become associated with a member thereof.
(3) The rules of the exchange assure a fair representation
of its members in the selection of its directors and administra-
tion of its affairs and provide that one or more directors shall
be representative of issuers and investors and not be associ-
ated with a member of the exchange, broker, or dealer.
(4) The rules of the exchange provide for the equitable allo-
cation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its
members and issuers and other persons using its facilities.
(5) The rules of the exchange are designed to prevent
fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, set-
tling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and per-
fect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national
market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the
public interest; and are not designed to permit unfair discrimi-
nation between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, or to
regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by this title mat-
ters not related to the purposes of this title or the administra-
tion of the exchange.
(6) The rules of the exchange provide that (subject to any
rule or order of the Commission pursuant to section 17(d) or
19(g)(2) of this title) its members and persons associated with
its members shall be appropriately disciplined for violation of
the provisions of this title, the rules or regulations thereunder,
or the rules of the exchange, by expulsion, suspension, limita-
tion of activities, functions, and operations, fine, censure, being
suspended or barred from being associated with a member, or
any other fitting sanction.
(7) The rules of the exchange are in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (d) of this section, and in general, pro-
vide a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and per-
sons associated with members, the denial of membership to
any person seeking membership therein, the barring of any
person from becoming associated with a member thereof, and
the prohibition or limitation by the exchange of any person

with respect to access to services offered by the exchange or a
member thereof.
(8) The rules of the exchange do not impose any burden on
competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of this title.
(9)(A) The rules of the exchange prohibit the listing of any
security issued in a limited partnership rollup transaction (as
such term is defined in paragraphs (4) and (5) of section 14(h)),
unless such transaction was conducted in accordance with pro-
cedures designed to protect the rights of limited partners, in-
cluding—
(i) the right of dissenting limited partners to one of the
following:
(I) an appraisal and compensation;
(II) retention of a security under substantially the
same terms and conditions as the original issue;
(III) approval of the limited partnership rollup
transaction by not less than 75 percent of the out-
standing securities of each of the participating limited
partnerships;
(IV) the use of a committee of limited partners
that is independent, as determined in accordance with
rules prescribed by the exchange, of the general part-
ner or sponsor, that has been approved by a majority
of the outstanding units of each of the participating
limited partnerships, and that has such authority as is
necessary to protect the interest of limited partners,
including the authority to hire independent advisors,
to negotiate with the general partner or sponsor on be-
half of the limited partners, and to make a rec-
ommendation to the limited partners with respect to
the proposed transaction; or
(V) other comparable rights that are prescribed by
rule by the exchange and that are designed to protect
dissenting limited partners;
(ii) the right not to have their voting power unfairly
reduced or abridged;
(iii) the right not to bear an unfair portion of the costs
of a proposed limited partnership rollup transaction that is
rejected; and
(iv) restrictions on the conversion of contingent inter-
ests or fees into non-contingent interests or fees and re-
strictions on the receipt of a non-contingent equity interest
in exchange for fees for services which have not yet been
provided.
(B) As used in this paragraph, the term ‘‘dissenting limited
partner’’ means a person who, on the date on which soliciting
material is mailed to investors, is a holder of a beneficial inter-
est in a limited partnership that is the subject of a limited
partnership rollup transaction, and who casts a vote against
the transaction and complies with procedures established by
the exchange, except that for purposes of an exchange or ten-
der offer, such person shall file an objection in writing under

the rules of the exchange during the period during which the
offer is outstanding.
(10)(A) The rules of the exchange prohibit any member
that is not the beneficial owner of a security registered under
section 12 from granting a proxy to vote the security in connec-
tion with a shareholder vote described in subparagraph (B),
unless the beneficial owner of the security has instructed the
member to vote the proxy in accordance with the voting in-
structions of the beneficial owner.
(B) A shareholder vote described in this subparagraph is
a shareholder vote with respect to the election of a member of
the board of directors of an issuer, executive compensation, or
any other significant matter, as determined by the Commis-
sion, by rule, and does not include a vote with respect to the
uncontested election of a member of the board of directors of
any investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b–1 et seq.).
(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to pro-
hibit a national securities exchange from prohibiting a member
that is not the beneficial owner of a security registered under
section 12 from granting a proxy to vote the security in connec-
tion with a shareholder vote not described in subparagraph
(A).
(c)(1) A national securities exchange shall deny membership to
(A) any person, other than a natural person, which is not a reg-
istered broker or dealer or (B) any natural person who is not, or
is not associated with, a registered broker or dealer.
(2) A national securities exchange may, and in cases in which
the Commission, by order, directs as necessary or appropriate in
the public interest or for the protection of investors shall, deny
membership to any registered broker or dealer or natural person
associated with a registered broker or dealer, and bar from becom-
ing associated with a member any person, who is subject to a statu-
tory disqualification. A national securities exchange shall file notice
with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting
any person to membership or permitting any person to become as-
sociated with a member, if the exchange knew, or in the exercise
of reasonable care should have known, that such person was sub-
ject to a statutory disqualification. The notice shall be in such form
and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may pre-
scribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors.
(3)(A) A national securities exchange may deny membership to,
or condition the membership of, a registered broker or dealer if (i)
such broker or dealer does not meet such standards of financial re-
sponsibility or operational capability or such broker or dealer or
any natural person associated with such broker or dealer does not
meet such standards of training, experience, and competence as are
prescribed by the rules of the exchange or (ii) such broker or dealer
or person associated with such broker or dealer has engaged and
there is a reasonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or
practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A
national securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifica-
tions of an applicant to become a member and the natural persons

associated with such an applicant in accordance with procedures
established by the rules of the exchange.
(B) A national securities exchange may bar a natural person
from becoming a member or associated with a member, or condition
the membership of a natural person or association of a natural per-
son with a member, if such natural person (i) does not meet such
standards of training, experience, and competence as are prescribed
by the rules of the exchange or (ii) has engaged and there is a rea-
sonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or practices incon-
sistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A national secu-
rities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an ap-
plicant to become a person associated with a member in accordance
with procedures established by the rules of the exchange and re-
quire any person associated with a member, or any class of such
persons, to be registered with the exchange in accordance with pro-
cedures so established.
(C) A national securities exchange may bar any person from
becoming associated with a member if such person does not agree
(i) to supply the exchange with such information with respect to its
relationship and dealings with the member as may be specified in
the rules of the exchange and (ii) to permit the examination of its
books and records to verify the accuracy of any information so sup-
plied.
(4) A national securities exchange may limit (A) the number of
members of the exchange and (B) the number of members and des-
ignated representatives of members permitted to effect transactions
on the floor of the exchange without the services of another person
acting as broker: Provided, however, That no national securities ex-
change shall have the authority to decrease the number of member-
ships in such exchange, or the number of members and designated
representatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the
floor of such exchange without the services of another person acting
as broker, below such number in effect on May 1, 1975, or the date
such exchange was registered with the Commission, whichever is
later: And provided further, That the Commission, in accordance
with the provisions of section 19(c) of this title, may amend the
rules of any national securities exchange to increase (but not to de-
crease) or to remove any limitation on the number of memberships
in such exchange or the number of members or designated rep-
resentatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the
floor of the exchange without the services of another person acting
as broker, if the Commission finds that such limitation imposes a
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of this title.
(d)(1) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to
determine whether a member or person associated with a member
should be disciplined (other than a summary proceeding pursuant
to paragraph (3) of this subsection), the exchange shall bring spe-
cific charges, notify such member or person of, and give him an op-
portunity to defend against, such charges, and keep a record. A de-
termination by the exchange to impose a disciplinary sanction shall
be supported by a statement setting forth—

(A) any act or practice in which such member or person as-
sociated with a member has been found to have engaged, or
which such member or person has been found to have omitted;
(B) the specific provision of this title, the rules or regula-
tions thereunder, or the rules of the exchange which any such
act or practice, or omission to act, is deemed to violate; and
(C) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor.
(2) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to de-
termine whether a person shall be denied membership, barred from
becoming associated with a member, or prohibited or limited with
respect to access to services offered by the exchange or a member
thereof (other than a summary proceeding pursuant to paragraph
(3) of this subsection), the exchange shall notify such person of, and
give him an opportunity to be heard upon, the specific grounds for
denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation under consideration and
keep a record. A determination by the exchange to deny member-
ship, bar a person from becoming associated with a member, or
prohibit or limit a person with respect to access to services offered
by the exchange or a member thereof shall be supported by a state-
ment setting forth the specific grounds on which the denial, bar, or
prohibition or limitation is based.
(3) A national securities exchange may summarily (A) suspend
a member or person associated with a member who has been and
is expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization or
barred or suspended from being associated with a member of any
self-regulatory organization, (B) suspend a member who is in such
financial or operating difficulty that the exchange determines and
so notifies the Commission that the member cannot be permitted
to continue to do business as a member with safety to investors,
creditors, other members, or the exchange, or (C) limit or prohibit
any person with respect to access to services offered by the ex-
change if subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph is applicable
to such person or, in the case of a person who is not a member,
if the exchange determines that such person does not meet the
qualification requirements or other prerequisites for such access
and such person cannot be permitted to continue to have such ac-
cess with safety to investors, creditors, members, or the exchange.
Any person aggrieved by any such summary action shall be
promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the exchange in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this sub-
section. The Commission, by order, may stay any such summary
action on its own motion or upon application by any person ag-
grieved thereby, if the Commission determines summarily or after
notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist sole-
ly of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments)
that such stay is consistent with the public interest and the protec-
tion of investors.
(e)(1) On and after the date of enactment of the Securities Acts
Amendments of 1975, no national securities exchange may impose
any schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or
other fees to be charged by its members: Provided, however, That

not prohibit any such exchange from imposing or fixing any sched-

change or as odd-lot dealer: And provided further, That the Com-
mission, in accordance with the provisions of section 19(b) of this
title as modified by the provisions of paragraph (3) of this sub-
section, may—
(A) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to im-
pose a reasonable schedule or fix reasonable rates of commis-
sions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its
members for effecting transactions on such exchange prior to
November 1, 1976, if the Commission finds that such schedule
or fixed rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other
fees are in the public interest; and
(B) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to im-
pose a schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, dis-
counts, or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting
transactions on such exchange after November 1, 1976, if the
Commission finds that such schedule or fixed rates of commis-
sions, allowances, discounts, or other fees (i) are reasonable in
relation to the costs of providing the service for which such
fees are charged (and the Commission publishes the standards
employed in adjudging reasonableness) and (ii) do not impose
any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title, taking into consideration
the competitive effects of permitting such schedule or fixed
rates weighed against the competitive effects of other lawful
actions which the Commission is authorized to take under this
title.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19(c) of this title,
the Commission, by rule, may abrogate any exchange rule which
imposes a schedule or fixes rates of commissions, allowances, dis-
counts, or other fees, if the Commission determines that such
schedule or fixed rates are no longer reasonable, in the public in-
terest, or necessary to accomplish the purposes of this title.
(3)(A) Before approving or disapproving any proposed rule
change submitted by a national securities exchange which would
impose a schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, dis-
counts, or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting
transactions on such exchange, the Commission shall afford inter-
ested persons (i) an opportunity for oral presentation of data,
views, and arguments and (ii) with respect to any such rule con-
cerning transactions effected after November 1, 1976, if the Com-
mission determines there are disputed issues of material fact, to
present such rebuttal submissions and to conduct (or have con-
ducted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) such cross-exam-
ination as the Commission determines to be appropriate and re-
quired for full disclosure and proper resolution of such disputed
issues of material fact.
(B) The Commission shall prescribe rules and make rulings
concerning any proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (A) of
this paragraph designed to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. Such
rules or rulings may (i) impose reasonable time limits on each in-
terested person’s oral presentations, and (ii) require any cross-ex-
amination to which a person may be entitled under subparagraph

graphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph and which have, in the view
of the Commission, the same or similar interests in the proceeding,
cannot agree upon a single representative of such interests for pur-
poses of cross-examination, the Commission may make rules and
rulings specifying the manner in which such interests shall be rep-
resented and such cross-examination conducted.
(ii) No member of any class of persons with respect to which
the Commission has specified the manner in which its interests
shall be represented pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph
shall be denied, pursuant to such clause (i), the opportunity to con-
duct (or have conducted) cross-examination as to issues affecting
his particular interests if he satisfies the Commission that he has
made a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement upon
group representation and there are substantial and relevant issues
which would not be presented adequately by group representation.
(D) A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation and
cross-examination.
(E) In addition to the bases specified in subsection 25(a), a re-
viewing Court may set aside an order of the Commission under sec-
tion 19(b) approving an exchange rule imposing a schedule or fixing
rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees, if the
Court finds—
(1) 9 a Commission determination under subparagraph (A)
of this paragraph that an interested person is not entitled to
conduct cross-examination or make rebuttal submissions, or
(2) 9 a Commission rule or ruling under subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph limiting the petitioner’s cross-examination or
rebuttal submissions,
has precluded full disclosure and proper resolution
of disputed issues of material fact which were nec-
essary for fair determination by the Commission.
(f) The Commission, by rule or order, as it deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of inves-
tors, to maintain fair and orderly markets, or to assure equal regu-
lation, may require—
(1) any person not a member or a designated representa-
tive of a member of a national securities exchange effecting
transactions on such exchange without the services of another
person acting as a broker, or

that has been designated a contract market by the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission and such designation

futures products may register for purposes of this section
by filing with the Commission a written notice in such

exchanges under section 6(a), as the Commission, by rule,
may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public in-
terest or for the protection of investors. If such exchange

MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
SEC. 7. ø78g¿ (a) For the purpose of preventing the excessive
use of credit for the purchase or carrying of securities, the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall, prior to the ef-
fective date of this section and from time to time thereafter, pre-
scribe rules and regulations with respect to the amount of credit
that may be initially extended and subsequently maintained on any
security (other than an exempted security or a security futures
product). For the initial extension of credit, such rules and regula-
tions shall be based upon the following standard: An amount not
greater than whichever is the higher of—
(1) 55 per centum of the current market price of the secu-
rity, or
(2) 100 per centum of the lowest market price of the secu-
rity during the preceding thirty-six calendar months, but not
more than 75 per centum of the current market price.
Such rules and regulations may make appropriate provision with
respect to the carrying of undermargined accounts for limited peri-
ods and under specified conditions; the withdrawal of funds or se-
curities; the substitution or additional purchases of securities; the
transfer of accounts from one lender to another; special or different
margin requirements for delayed deliveries, short sales, arbitrage
transactions, and securities to which paragraph (2) of this sub-
section does not apply; the bases and the methods to be used in cal-
culating loans, and margins and market prices; and similar admin-
istrative adjustments and details. For the purposes of paragraph
(2) of this subsection until July 1, 1936, the lowest price at which
a security has sold on or after July 1, 1933, shall be considered as
the lowest price at which such security has sold during the pre-
ceding thirty-six calendar months.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this sec-
tion, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, may,
from time to time, with respect to all or specified securities or
transactions, or classes of securities, or classes of transactions, by
such rules and regulations (1) prescribe such lower margin require-
ments for the initial extension or maintenance of credit as it deems
necessary or appropriate for the accommodation of commerce and
industry, having due regard to the general credit situation of the
country, and (2) prescribe such higher margin requirements for the
initial extension or maintenance of credit as it may deem necessary
or appropriate to prevent the excessive use of credit to finance
transactions in securities.
(c) UNLAWFUL CREDIT EXTENSION TO CUSTOMERS.—
(1) PROHIBITION.—It shall be unlawful for any member of
a national securities exchange or any broker or dealer, directly
or indirectly, to extend or maintain credit or arrange for the
extension or maintenance of credit to or for any customer—
(A) on any security (other than an exempted security),
except as provided in paragraph (2), in contravention of
the rules and regulations which the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (hereafter in this section re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Board’’) shall prescribe under subsections
(a) and (b); or

securities, except in accordance with such rules and regu-
lations as the Board may prescribe—
(i) to permit under specified conditions and for a
limited period any such member, broker, or dealer to
maintain a credit initially extended in conformity with
the rules and regulations of the Board; and
(ii) to permit the extension or maintenance of
credit in cases where the extension or maintenance of
credit is not for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
securities or of evading or circumventing the provi-
sions of subparagraph (A).
(2) MARGIN REGULATIONS.—
(A) COMPLIANCE WITH MARGIN RULES REQUIRED.—It
shall be unlawful for any broker, dealer, or member of a
national securities exchange to, directly or indirectly, ex-
tend or maintain credit to or for, or collect margin from
any customer on, any security futures product unless such
activities comply with the regulations—
(i) which the Board shall prescribe pursuant to
subparagraph (B); or
(ii) if the Board determines to delegate the author-
ity to prescribe such regulations, which the Commis-
sion and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
shall jointly prescribe pursuant to subparagraph (B).
If the Board delegates the authority to prescribe such reg-
ulations under clause (ii) and the Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission have not jointly
prescribed such regulations within a reasonable period of
time after the date of such delegation, the Board shall pre-
scribe such regulations pursuant to subparagraph (B).
(B) CRITERIA FOR ISSUANCE OF RULES.—The Board
shall prescribe, or, if the authority is delegated pursuant
to subparagraph (A)(ii), the Commission and the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission shall jointly pre-
scribe, such regulations to establish margin requirements,
including the establishment of levels of margin (initial and
maintenance) for security futures products under such
terms, and at such levels, as the Board deems appropriate,
or as the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission jointly deem appropriate—
(i) to preserve the financial integrity of markets
trading security futures products;
(ii) to prevent systemic risk;
(iii) to require that—
(I) the margin requirements for a security fu-
ture product be consistent with the margin re-
quirements for comparable option contracts traded
on any exchange registered pursuant to section
6(a) of this title; and
(II) initial and maintenance margin levels for
a security future product not be lower than the
lowest level of margin, exclusive of premium, re-
quired for any comparable option contract traded

prevent the excessive use of credit for the purchasing or car-
rying of or trading in securities in circumvention of the other

SEC. 10A. ø78j–1¿ AUDIT REQUIREMENTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Each audit required pursuant to this title of
the financial statements of an issuer by a registered public ac-
counting firm shall include, in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented from time
to time by the Commission—
(1) procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of
detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material ef-
fect on the determination of financial statement amounts;
(2) procedures designed to identify related party trans-
actions that are material to the financial statements or other-
wise require disclosure therein; and
(3) an evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt
about the ability of the issuer to continue as a going concern
during the ensuing fiscal year.
(b) REQUIRED RESPONSE TO AUDIT DISCOVERIES.—
(1) INVESTIGATION AND REPORT TO MANAGEMENT.—If, in
the course of conducting an audit pursuant to this title to
which subsection (a) applies, the registered public accounting
firm detects or otherwise becomes aware of information indi-
cating that an illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a
material effect on the financial statements of the issuer) has
or may have occurred, the firm shall, in accordance with gen-
erally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or sup-
plemented from time to time by the Commission—
(A)(i) determine whether it is likely that an illegal act
has occurred; and
(ii) if so, determine and consider the possible effect of
the illegal act on the financial statements of the issuer, in-
cluding any contingent monetary effects, such as fines,
penalties, and damages; and

(B) as soon as practicable, inform the appropriate level
of the management of the issuer and assure that the audit
committee of the issuer, or the board of directors of the
issuer in the absence of such a committee, is adequately
informed with respect to illegal acts that have been de-
tected or have otherwise come to the attention of such firm
in the course of the audit, unless the illegal act is clearly
inconsequential.
(2) RESPONSE TO FAILURE TO TAKE REMEDIAL ACTION.—If,
after determining that the audit committee of the board of di-
rectors of the issuer, or the board of directors of the issuer in
the absence of an audit committee, is adequately informed with
respect to illegal acts that have been detected or have other-
wise come to the attention of the firm in the course of the
audit of such accountant, the registered public accounting firm
concludes that—
(A) the illegal act has a material effect on the financial
statements of the issuer;
(B) the senior management has not taken, and the
board of directors has not caused senior management to
take, timely and appropriate remedial actions with respect
to the illegal act; and
(C) the failure to take remedial action is reasonably
expected to warrant departure from a standard report of
the auditor, when made, or warrant resignation from the
audit engagement;
the registered public accounting firm shall, as soon as prac-
ticable, directly report its conclusions to the board of directors.
(3) NOTICE TO COMMISSION; RESPONSE TO FAILURE TO NO-
TIFY.—An issuer whose board of directors receives a report
under paragraph (2) shall inform the Commission by notice not
later than 1 business day after the receipt of such report and
shall furnish the registered public accounting firm making
such report with a copy of the notice furnished to the Commis-
sion. If the registered public accounting firm fails to receive a
copy of the notice before the expiration of the required 1-busi-
ness-day period, the registered public accounting firm shall—
(A) resign from the engagement; or
(B) furnish to the Commission a copy of its report (or
the documentation of any oral report given) not later than
1 business day following such failure to receive notice.
(4) REPORT AFTER RESIGNATION.—If a registered public ac-
counting firm resigns from an engagement under paragraph
(3)(A), the firm shall, not later than 1 business day following
the failure by the issuer to notify the Commission under para-
graph (3), furnish to the Commission a copy of the report of the
firm (or the documentation of any oral report given).
(c) AUDITOR LIABILITY LIMITATION.—No registered public ac-
counting firm shall be liable in a private action for any finding,
conclusion, or statement expressed in a report made pursuant to
paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b), including any rule promul-
gated pursuant thereto.

erned by the standards set forth in section 21B.

vided in subsection (d), nothing in this section shall be held to limit
or otherwise affect the authority of the Commission under this
title.(f) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term ‘‘illegal act’’
means an act or omission that violates any law, or any rule or reg-
ulation having the force of law. As used in this section, the term
‘‘issuer’’ means an issuer (as defined in section 3), the securities of
which are registered under section 12, or that is required to file re-

ties Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), and that it has not with-
drawn.

any associated person of that firm, to the extent determined appro-
priate by the Commission) that performs for any issuer any audit

title or, beginning 180 days after the date of commencement of the
operations of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board es-
tablished under section 101 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (in

istered public accounting firm may engage in any non-audit service,
including tax services, that is not described in any of paragraphs
(1) through (9) of subsection (g) for an audit client, only if the activ-
ity is approved in advance by the audit committee of the issuer, in

mittee at each of its scheduled meetings.
(4) APPROVAL OF AUDIT SERVICES FOR OTHER PURPOSES.—
In carrying out its duties under subsection (m)(2), if the audit
committee of an issuer approves an audit service within the

be deemed to have been preapproved for purposes of this sub-
section.

normally is derived principally from such business and related
activities and (ii) such transaction is effected in compliance

change;

maintain fair and orderly markets, or to assure equal regulation of
exchange markets and markets occurring otherwise than on an ex-
change, may regulate or prohibit:

(C) transactions on a national securities exchange effected

of such broker or dealer (unless such broker or dealer is acting
in the capacity of market maker), the account of an associated
person, or an account with respect to which such broker or

The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection insofar as
they apply to transactions on a national securities exchange ef-
fected by a member thereof who was a member on February 1,
1978 shall not become effective until February 1, 1979. Nothing in
this paragraph shall be construed to impair or limit the authority
of the Commission to regulate or prohibit such transactions prior
to February 1, 1979, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(b) When not in contravention of such rules and regulations as
the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest and for the protection of investors, to maintain fair
and orderly markets, or to remove impediments to and perfect the
mechanism of a national market system, the rules of a national se-
curities exchange may permit (1) a member to be registered as an
odd-lot dealer and as such to buy and sell for his own account so
far as may be reasonably necessary to carry on such odd-lot trans-
actions, and (2) a member to be registered as a specialist. Under
the rules and regulations of the Commission a specialist may be
permitted to act as a broker and dealer or limited to acting as a
broker or dealer. It shall be unlawful for a specialist or an official
of the exchange to disclose information in regard to orders placed
with such specialist which is not available to all members of the
exchange, to any person other than an official of the exchange, a
representative of the Commission, or a specialist who may be act-
ing for such specialist: Provided, however, That the Commission, by
rule, may require disclosure to all members of the exchange of all
orders placed with specialists, under such rules and regulations as
the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors. It shall also be un-
lawful for a specialist permitted to act as a broker and dealer to
effect on the exchange as broker any transaction except upon a
market or limited price order.
(c) If because of the limited volume of transactions effected on
an exchange, it is in the opinion of the Commission impracticable
and not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors to apply any of the foregoing provisions of

sion shall have power, upon application of the exchange and on a
showing that the rules of such exchange are otherwise adequate for
the protection of investors, to exempt such exchange and its mem-
bers from any such provision or rules and regulations.
(d) It shall be unlawful for a member of a national securities
exchange who is both a dealer and a broker, or for any person who
both as a broker and a dealer transacts a business in securities
through the medium of a member or otherwise, to effect through

NATIONAL MARKET SYSTEM FOR SECURITIES; SECURITIES
INFORMATION PROCESSORS

which must be preserved and strengthened.
(B) New data processing and communications techniques
create the opportunity for more efficient and effective market
operations.
(C) It is in the public interest and appropriate for the pro-
tection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets to assure—
(i) economically efficient execution of securities trans-
actions;
(ii) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among
exchange markets, and between exchange markets and
markets other than exchange markets;
(iii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors
of information with respect to quotations for and trans-
actions in securities;
(iv) the practicability of brokers executing investors’
orders in the best market; and
(v) an opportunity, consistent with the provisions of
clauses (i) and (iv) of this subparagraph, for investors’ or-
ders to be executed without the participation of a dealer.
(D) The linking of all markets for qualified securities
through communication and data processing facilities will fos-
ter efficiency, enhance competition, increase the information
available to brokers, dealers, and investors, facilitate the off-
setting of investors’ orders, and contribute to best execution of
such orders.

market system from among securities other than exempted securi-
ties. (Securities or classes of securities so designated hereinafter in
this section referred to as ‘‘qualified securities’’.)
(3) The Commission is authorized in furtherance of the direc-
tive in paragraph (2) of this subsection—
(A) to create one or more advisory committees pursuant to
chapter 10 of title 5, United States Code (which shall be in ad-
dition to the National Market Advisory Board established pur-
suant to subsection (d) of this section), and to employ one or
more outside experts;
(B) by rule or order, to authorize or require self-regulatory
organizations to act jointly with respect to matters as to which
they share authority under this title in planning, developing,
operating, or regulating a national market system (or a sub-
system thereof) or one or more facilities thereof; and
(C) to conduct studies and make recommendations to the
Congress from time to time as to the possible need for modi-
fications of the scheme of self-regulation provided for in this
title so as to adapt it to a national market system.
(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be
unlawful for any securities information processor unless registered
in accordance with this subsection, directly or indirectly, to make
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate com-
merce to perform the functions of a securities information proc-
essor. The Commission, by rule or order, upon its own motion or
upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any
securities information processor or class of securities information
processors or security or class of securities from any provision of
this section or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commis-
sion finds that such exemption is consistent with the public inter-
est, the protection of investors, and the purposes of this section, in-
cluding the maintenance of fair and orderly markets in securities
and the removal of impediments to and perfection of the mecha-
nism of a national market system: Provided, however, That a secu-
rities information processor not acting as the exclusive processor of
any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in
securities is exempt from the requirement to register in accordance
with this subsection unless the Commission, by rule or order, finds
that the registration of such securities information processor is nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of in-
vestors, or for the achievement of the purposes of this section.
(2) A securities information processor may be registered by fil-
ing with the Commission an application for registration in such
form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe containing the ad-
dress of its principal office, or offices, the names of the securities

to act as a securities information processor, and such other infor-
mation and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe
with regard to performance capability, standards and procedures
for the collection, processing, distribution, and publication of infor-
mation with respect to quotations for and transactions in securi-
ties, personnel qualifications, financial condition, and such other
matters as the Commission determines to be germane to the provi-
sions of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder, or nec-
essary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section.
(3) The Commission shall, upon the filing of an application for
registration pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, publish
notice of the filing and afford interested persons an opportunity to
submit written data, views, and arguments concerning such appli-
cation. Within ninety days of the date of the publication of such no-
tice (or within such longer period as to which the applicant con-
sents) the Commission shall—
(A) by order grant such registration, or
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration
should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the
grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for
hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred eighty days
of the date of publication of notice of the filing of the applica-
tion for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings the
Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration.
The Commission may extend the time for the conclusion of
such proceedings for up to sixty days if it finds good cause for
such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for
such longer periods as to which the applicant consents.
The Commission shall grant the registration of a securities infor-
mation processor if the Commission finds that such securities infor-
mation processor is so organized, and has the capacity, to be able
to assure the prompt, accurate, and reliable performance of its
functions as a securities information processor, comply with the
provisions of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder,
carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes
of this section, and, insofar as it is acting as an exclusive processor,
operate fairly and efficiently. The Commission shall deny the reg-
istration of a securities information processor if the Commission
does not make any such finding.
(4) A registered securities information processor may, upon
such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal
with the Commission. If the Commission finds that any registered
securities information processor is no longer in existence or has
ceased to do business in the capacity specified in its application for
registration, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the registra-
tion.(5)(A) If any registered securities information processor pro-
hibits or limits any person in respect of access to services offered,
directly or indirectly, by such securities information processor, the
registered securities information processor shall promptly file no-
tice thereof with the Commission. The notice shall be in such form

scribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. Any prohibition or limitation on access to
services with respect to which a registered securities information
processor is required by this paragraph to file notice shall be sub-
ject to review by the Commission on its own motion, or upon appli-
cation by any person aggrieved thereby filed within thirty days
after such notice has been filed with the Commission and received
by such aggrieved person, or within such longer period as the Com-
mission may determine. Application to the Commission for review,
or the institution of review by the Commission on its own motion,
shall not operate as a stay of such prohibition or limitation, unless
the Commission otherwise orders, summarily or after notice and
opportunity for hearing on the question of a stay (which hearing
may consist solely of the submission of affidavits or presentation of
oral arguments). The Commission shall establish for appropriate
cases an expedited procedure for consideration and determination
of the question of a stay.
(B) In any proceeding to review the prohibition or limitation of
any person in respect of access to services offered by a registered
securities information processor, if the Commission finds, after no-
tice and opportunity for hearing, that such prohibition or limitation
is consistent with the provisions of this title and the rules and reg-
ulations thereunder and that such person has not been discrimi-
nated against unfairly, the Commission, by order, shall dismiss the
proceeding. If the Commission does not make any such finding or
if it finds that such prohibition or limitation imposes any burden
on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of this title, the Commission, by order, shall set aside the
prohibition or limitation and require the registered securities infor-
mation processor to permit such person access to services offered
by the registered securities information processor.
(6) The Commission, by order, may censure or place limitations
upon the activities, functions, or operations of any registered secu-
rities information processor or suspend for a period not exceeding
twelve months or revoke the registration of any such processor, if
the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity
for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension,
or revocation is in the public interest, necessary or appropriate for
the protection of investors or to assure the prompt, accurate, or re-
liable performance of the functions of such securities information
processor, and that such securities information processor has vio-
lated or is unable to comply with any provision of this title or the
rules or regulations thereunder.

publication any information with respect to quotations for or trans-
actions in any security other than an exempted security, to assist,
participate in, or coordinate the distribution or publication of such

(B) assure the prompt, accurate, reliable, and fair collec-

with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securi-
ties and the fairness and usefulness of the form and content
of such information;
(C) assure that all securities information processors may,
for purposes of distribution and publication, obtain on fair and
reasonable terms such information with respect to quotations
for and transactions in such securities as is collected, proc-
essed, or prepared for distribution or publication by any exclu-
sive processor of such information acting in such capacity;

curities information processors, and, subject to such limitations
as the Commission, by rule, may impose as necessary or appro-
priate for the protection of investors or maintenance of fair and
orderly markets, all other persons may obtain on terms which
are not unreasonably discriminatory such information with re-
spect to quotations for and transactions in such securities as
is published or distributed by any self-regulatory organization
or securities information processor;
(E) assure that all exchange members, brokers, and deal-
ers transmit and direct orders for the purchase or sale of quali-
fied securities in a manner consistent with the establishment
and operation of a national market system; and
(F) assure equal regulation of all markets for qualified se-
curities and all exchange members, brokers, and dealers effect-
ing transactions in such securities.
(2) The Commission, by rule, as it deems necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, may
require any person who has effected the purchase or sale of any
qualified security by use of the mails or any means or instrumen-
tality of interstate commerce to report such purchase or sale to a
registered securities information processor, national securities ex-
change, or registered securities association and require such proc-
essor, exchange, or association to make appropriate distribution
and publication of information with respect to such purchase or
sale.

kers and dealers from effecting transactions in securities registered
pursuant to section 12(b) otherwise than on a national securities
exchange, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and
opportunity for hearing, that—
(i) as a result of transactions in such securities effected
otherwise than on a national securities exchange the fairness
or orderliness of the markets for such securities has been af-
fected in a manner contrary to the public interest or the pro-
tection of investors;

ably impairs the ability of any dealer to solicit or effect trans-

specialists in such securities and such dealers who are not spe-
cialists in such securities, and
(iii) the maintenance or restoration of fair and orderly
markets in such securities may not be assured through other
lawful means under this title.
The Commission may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any
security or transaction or any class of securities or transactions
from any such prohibition if the Commission deems such exemption
consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.
(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph,
the ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in securities
for his own account shall not be deemed to be unreasonably im-
paired by any rule of an exchange fairly and reasonably prescribing
the sequence in which orders brought to the exchange must be exe-
cuted or which has been adopted to effect compliance with a rule
of the Commission promulgated under this title.
(4) The Commission is directed to review any and all rules of
national securities exchanges which limit or condition the ability of
members to effect transactions in securities otherwise than on such
exchanges.
(5) No national securities exchange or registered securities as-
sociation may limit or condition the participation of any member in
any registered clearing agency.
(6) TICK SIZE.—
(A) STUDY AND REPORT.—The Commission shall con-
duct a study examining the transition to trading and
quoting securities in one penny increments, also known as
decimalization. The study shall examine the impact that
decimalization has had on the number of initial public of-
ferings since its implementation relative to the period be-
fore its implementation. The study shall also examine the
impact that this change has had on liquidity for small and
middle capitalization company securities and whether
there is sufficient economic incentive to support trading
operations in these securities in penny increments. Not
later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this para-
graph, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report
on the findings of the study.
(B) D ESIGNATION.—If the Commission determines that
the securities of emerging growth companies should be
quoted and traded using a minimum increment of greater
than $0.01, the Commission may, by rule not later than
180 days after the date of enactment of this paragraph,
designate a minimum increment for the securities of
emerging growth companies that is greater than $0.01 but
less than $0.10 for use in all quoting and trading of securi-
ties in any exchange or other execution venue.

(d)(1) Not later than one hundred eighty days after the date of
enactment of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, the Com-
mission shall establish a National Market Advisory Board (herein-
after in this section referred to as the ‘‘Advisory Board’’) to be com-
posed of fifteen members, not all of whom shall be from the same
geographical area of the United States, appointed by the Commis-
sion for a term specified by the Commission of not less than two
years or more than five years. The Advisory Board shall consist of
persons associated with brokers and dealers (who shall be a major-
ity) and persons not so associated who are representative of the
public and, to the extent feasible, have knowledge of the securities
markets of the United States.
(2) It shall be the responsibility of the Advisory Board to for-
mulate and furnish to the Commission its views on significant reg-
ulatory proposals made by the Commission or any self-regulatory
organization concerning the establishment, operation, and regula-
tion of the markets for securities in the United States.
(3)(A) The Advisory Board shall study and make recommenda-
tions to the Commission as to the steps it finds appropriate to fa-
cilitate the establishment of a national market system. In so doing,
the Advisory Board shall assume the responsibilities of any advi-
sory committee appointed to advise the Commission with respect to
the national market system which is in existence at the time of the
establishment of the Advisory Board.
(B) The Advisory Board shall study the possible need for modi-
fications of the scheme of self-regulation provided for in this title
so as to adapt it to a national market system, including the need
for the establishment of a new self-regulatory organization (herein-
after in this section referred to as a ‘‘National Market Regulatory
Board’’ or ‘‘Regulatory Board’’) to administer the national market
system. In the event the Advisory Board determines a National
Market Regulatory Board should be established, it shall make rec-
ommendations as to:
(i) the point in time at which a Regulatory Board should
be established;
(ii) the composition of a Regulatory Board;
(iii) the scope of the authority of a Regulatory Board;
(iv) the relationship of a Regulatory Board to the Commis-
sion and to existing self-regulatory organizations; and
(v) the manner in which a Regulatory Board should be
funded.
The Advisory Board shall report to the Congress, on or before De-
cember 31, 1976, the results of such study and its recommenda-
tions, including such recommendations for legislation as it deems
appropriate.
(C) In carrying out its responsibilities under this paragraph,
the Advisory Board shall consult with self-regulatory organizations,
brokers, dealers, securities information processors, issuers, inves-
tors, representatives of Government agencies, and other persons in-
terested or likely to participate in the establishment, operation, or
regulation of the national market system.

spect to security futures products, the Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall consult and co-
operate so that, to the maximum extent practicable, their re-
spective regulatory responsibilities may be fulfilled and the
rules and regulations applicable to security futures products
may foster a national market system for security futures prod-
ucts if the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission jointly determine that such a system would be
consistent with the congressional findings in subsection (a)(1).
In accordance with this objective, the Commission shall, at
least 15 days prior to the issuance for public comment of any
proposed rule or regulation under this section concerning secu-
rity futures products, consult and request the views of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
(2) APPLICATION OF RULES BY ORDER OF CFTC.—No rule
adopted pursuant to this section shall be applied to any person
with respect to the trading of security futures products on an
exchange that is registered under section 6(g) unless the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission has issued an order di-
recting that such rule is applicable to such persons.

quired under subsection (b) of this section is inapplicable to any
specified class or classes of issuers, the Commission shall require
in lieu thereof the submission of such other information of com-
parable character as it may deem applicable to such class of
issuers.

tion, any national securities exchange, in accordance with the re-
quirements of this subsection and the rules hereunder, may extend
unlisted trading privileges to—
(i) any security that is listed and registered on a national
securities exchange, subject to subparagraph (B); and
(ii) any security that is otherwise registered pursuant to
this section, or that would be required to be so registered ex-
cept for the exemption from registration provided in subpara-
graph (B) or (G) of subsection (g)(2), subject to subparagraph
(E) of this paragraph.
(B) A national securities exchange may not extend unlisted
trading privileges to a security described in subparagraph (A)(i)
during such interval, if any, after the commencement of an initial
public offering of such security, as is or may be required pursuant
to subparagraph (C).
(C) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the
Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994, the Commission shall pre-
scribe, by rule or regulation, the duration of the interval referred
to in subparagraph (B), if any, as the Commission determines to be
necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets, the protection of investors and the public interest, or oth-
erwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. Until the earlier
of the effective date of such rule or regulation or 240 days after
such date of enactment, such interval shall begin at the opening of
trading on the day on which such security commences trading on
the national securities exchange with which such security is reg-
istered and end at the conclusion of the next day of trading.
(D) The Commission may prescribe, by rule or regulation such
additional procedures or requirements for extending unlisted trad-
ing privileges to any security as the Commission deems necessary
or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the
protection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.

issuing such order, the Commission—
(i) shall find that such extension or extensions of unlisted
trading privileges is consistent with the maintenance of fair
and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public
interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this
title;(ii) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
securities, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such securities, and the de-
sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(iii) shall not permit a national securities exchange to ex-
tend unlisted trading privileges to such securities if any rule
of such national securities exchange would unreasonably im-
pair the ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in
such securities for its own account, or would unreasonably re-
strict competition among dealers in such securities or between
such dealers acting in the capacity of market makers who are
specialists and such dealers who are not specialists.
(F) An exchange may continue to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges in accordance with this paragraph only if the exchange and
the subject security continue to satisfy the requirements for eligi-
bility under this paragraph, including any rules and regulations
issued by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph, except that
unlisted trading privileges may continue with regard to securities
which had been admitted on such exchange prior to July 1, 1964,
notwithstanding the failure to satisfy such requirements. If un-
listed trading privileges in a security are discontinued pursuant to
this subparagraph, the exchange shall cease trading in that secu-
rity, unless the exchange and the subject security thereafter satisfy
the requirements of this paragraph and the rules issued hereunder.
(G) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) a security is the subject of an initial public offering if—
(I) the offering of the subject security is registered
under the Securities Act of 1933; and
(II) the issuer of the security, immediately prior to fil-
ing the registration statement with respect to the offering,
was not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13
or 15(d) of this title; and
(ii) an initial public offering of such security commences at
the opening of trading on the day on which such security com-
mences trading on the national securities exchange with which
such security is registered.
(2)(A) At any time within 60 days of commencement of trading
on an exchange of a security pursuant to unlisted trading privi-
leges, the Commission may summarily suspend such unlisted trad-
ing privileges on the exchange. Such suspension shall not be re-
viewable under section 25 of this title and shall not be deemed to
be a final agency action for purposes of section 704 of title 5,
United States Code. Upon such suspension—
(i) the exchange shall cease trading in the security by the
close of business on the date of such suspension, or at such

time as the Commission may prescribe by rule or order for the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of this title; and
(ii) if the exchange seeks to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges to the security, the exchange shall file an application to
reinstate its ability to do so with the Commission pursuant to
such procedures as the Commission may prescribe by rule or
order for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the pro-
tection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.
(B) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect
until the Commission, by order, grants approval of an application
to reinstate, as described in subparagraph (A)(ii).
(C) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall not affect the
validity or force of an extension of unlisted trading privileges in ef-
fect prior to such suspension.
(D) The Commission shall not approve an application by a na-
tional securities exchange to reinstate its ability to extend unlisted
trading privileges to a security unless the Commission finds, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that the extension of unlisted
trading privileges pursuant to such application is consistent with
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of this title. If the application is made to reinstate un-
listed trading privileges to a security described in paragraph
(1)(A)(ii), the Commission—
(i) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
security, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such a security, and the de-
sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(ii) shall not grant any such application if any rule of the
national securities exchange making application under this
subsection would unreasonably impair the ability of a dealer to
solicit or effect transactions in such security for its own ac-
count, or would unreasonably restrict competition among deal-
ers in such security or between such dealers acting in the ca-
pacity of marketmakers who are specialists and such dealers
who are not specialists.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the Commission shall by
rules and regulations suspend unlisted trading privileges in whole
or in part for any or all classes of securities for a period not exceed-
ing twelve months, if it deems such suspension necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or to
prevent evasion of the purposes of this title.

unlisted trading privileges on any exchange have been continued or
extended pursuant to this subsection, or of any broker or dealer
who makes or creates a market for such security, or of any other
person having a bona fide interest in the question of termination
or suspension of such unlisted trading privileges, or on its own mo-

(5) In any proceeding under this subsection in which appro-
priate notice and opportunity for hearing are required, notice of not
less than ten days to the applicant in such proceeding, to the issuer
of the security involved, to the exchange which is seeking to con-
tinue or extend or has continued or extended unlisted trading privi-
leges for such security, and to the exchange, if any, on which such
security is listed and registered, shall be deemed adequate notice,
and any broker or dealer who makes or creates a market for such
security, and any other person having a bona fide interest in such
proceeding, shall upon application be entitled to be heard.
(6) Any security for which unlisted trading privileges are con-
tinued or extended pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to
be registered on a national securities exchange within the meaning
of this title. The powers and duties of the Commission under this
title shall be applicable to the rules of an exchange in respect to
any such security. The Commission may, by such rules and regula-
tions as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors, either unconditionally or upon speci-
fied terms and conditions, or for stated periods, exempt such secu-
rities from the operation of any provision of section 13, 14, or 16
of this title.

in a business affecting interstate commerce, or whose securities are
traded by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce shall—

ended on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by either—
(i) 12 2,000 persons, or
(ii) 500 persons who are not accredited investors (as such
term is defined by the Commission), and
(B) in the case of an issuer that is a bank, a savings and
loan holding company (as defined in section 10 of the Home
Owners’ Loan Act), or a bank holding company, as such term
is defined in section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), not later than 120 days after the last
day of its first fiscal year ended after the effective date of this
subsection, on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by 2,000 or more persons,
register such security by filing with the Commission a registration
statement (and such copies thereof as the Commission may require)

within such shorter period as the Commission may direct. Until
such registration statement becomes effective it shall not be
deemed filed for the purposes of section 18 of this title. Any issuer
may register any class of equity security not required to be reg-
istered by filing a registration statement pursuant to the provisions
of this paragraph. The Commission is authorized to extend the date
upon which any issuer or class of issuers is required to register a
security pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply in respect
of— (A) any security listed and registered on a national securi-
ties exchange.
(B) any security issued by an investment company reg-
istered pursuant to section 8 of the Investment Company Act
of 1940.
(C) any security, other than permanent stock, guaranty
stock, permanent reserve stock, or any similar certificate evi-
dencing nonwithdrawable capital, issued by a savings and loan
association, building and loan association, cooperative bank,
homestead association, or similar institution, which is super-
vised and examined by State or Federal authority having su-
pervision over any such institution.
(D) any security of an issuer organized and operated exclu-
sively for religious, educational, benevolent, fraternal, chari-
table, or reformatory purposes and not for pecuniary profit,
and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit
of any private shareholder or individual; or any security of a
fund that is excluded from the definition of an investment com-
pany under section 3(c)(10)(B) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940.
(E) any security of an issuer which is a ‘‘cooperative asso-
ciation’’ as defined in the Agricultural Marketing Act, approved
June 15, 1929, as amended, or a federation of such cooperative
associations, if such federation possesses no greater powers or
purposes than cooperative associations so defined.
(F) any security issued by a mutual or cooperative organi-
zation which supplies a commodity or service primarily for the
benefit of its members and operates not for pecuniary profit,
but only if the security is part of a class issuable only to per-
sons who purchase commodities or services from the issuer, the
security is transferable only to a successor in interest or occu-
pancy of premises serviced or to be served by the issuer, and
no dividends are payable to the holder of the security.
(G) any security issued by an insurance company if all of
the following conditions are met:
(i) Such insurance company is required to and does file
an annual statement with the Commissioner of Insurance
(or other officer or agency performing a similar function)
of its domiciliary State, and such annual statement con-
forms to that prescribed by the National Association of In-
surance Commissioners or in the determination of such
State commissioner, officer or agency substantially con-
forms to that so prescribed.

its domiciliary State of proxies, consents, or authorizations
in respect of securities issued by such company and such
regulation conforms to that prescribed by the National As-
sociation of Insurance Commissioners.
(iii) After July 1, 1966, the purchase and sales of secu-

Code, or (iii) a church plan, company, or account that is ex-
cluded from the definition of an investment company under

(3) The Commission may by rules or regulations or, on its own
motion, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order, exempt
from this subsection any security of a foreign issuer, including any
certificate of deposit for such a security, if the Commission finds
that such exemption is in the public interest and is consistent with
the protection of investors.
(4) Registration of any class of security pursuant to this sub-
section shall be terminated ninety days, or such shorter period as
the Commission may determine, after the issuer files a certification
with the Commission that the number of holders of record of such
class of security is reduced to less than 300 persons, or, in the case
of a bank, a savings and loan holding company (as defined in sec-
tion 10 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act), or a bank holding com-

determination on the question of denial.

action is not inconsistent with the public interest or the protection

tion of investors, and publish such findings, and the detailed rea-
sons therefor, in the Federal Register. Such regulations of the
above-named agencies, or the reasons for failure to publish such
substantially similar regulations to those of the Commission, shall

the protection of investors to attain an objective described
in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A). In no event
shall an order of the Commission under this paragraph

Commission pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to re-
view only as provided in section 25(a) of this title. Review shall
be based on an examination of all the information before the
Commission at the time such order was issued. The reviewing
court shall not enter a stay, writ of mandamus, or similar re-
lief unless the court finds, after notice and hearing before a

capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord-
ance with law.

in paragraph (1)(B), the Commission shall consult with and
consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission, unless such consultation
is impracticable in light of the emergency.

operation of the national system for clearance and set-
tlement of transactions in securities, or a substantial

ment companies, or any other significant portion or

(l) It shall be unlawful for an issuer, any class of whose securi-
ties is registered pursuant to this section or would be required to
be so registered except for the exemption from registration pro-
vided by subsection (g)(2)(B) or (g)(2)(G) of this section, by the use
of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the
mails, to issue, either originally or upon transfer, any of such secu-
rities in a form or with a format which contravenes such rules and
regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or ap-
propriate for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of
transactions in securities. The provisions of this subsection shall
not apply to variable annuity contracts or variable life policies

(and such copies thereof), as the Commission may prescribe.
Every issuer of a security registered on a national securities ex-
change shall also file a duplicate original of such information, docu-
ments, and reports with the exchange. In any registration state-
ment, periodic report, or other reports to be filed with the Commis-
sion, an emerging growth company need not present selected finan-
cial data in accordance with section 229.301 of title 17, Code of
Federal Regulations, for any period prior to the earliest audited pe-
riod presented in connection with its first registration statement
that became effective under this Act or the Securities Act of 1933
and, with respect to any such statement or reports, an emerging
growth company may not be required to comply with any new or
revised financial accounting standard until such date that a com-
pany that is not an issuer (as defined under section 2(a) of the Sar-
banes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201(a))) is required to comply
with such new or revised accounting standard, if such standard ap-
plies to companies that are not issuers.
(b)(1) The Commission may prescribe, in regard to reports
made pursuant to this title, the form or forms in which the re-
quired information shall be set forth, the items or details to be
shown in the balance sheet and the earnings statement, and the
methods to be followed in the preparation of reports, in the ap-
praisal or valuation of assets and liabilities, in the determination
of depreciation and depletion, in the differentiation of recurring
and nonrecurring income, in the differentiation of investment and
operating income, and in the preparation, where the Commission
deems it necessary or desirable, of separate and/or consolidated
balance sheets or income accounts of any person directly or indi-
rectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any person under
direct or indirect common control with the issuer; but in the case
of the reports of any person whose methods of accounting are pre-
scribed under the provisions of any law of the United States, or any
rule or regulation thereunder, the rules and regulations of the
Commission with respect to reports shall not be inconsistent with
the requirements imposed by such law or rule or regulation in re-
spect of the same subject matter (except that such rules and regu-
lations of the Commission may be inconsistent with such require-
ments to the extent that the Commission determines that the pub-
lic interest or the protection of investors so requires).
(2) Every issuer which has a class of securities registered pur-
suant to section 12 of this title and every issuer which is required
to file reports pursuant to section 15(d) of this title shall—

(A) make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the issuer;
(B) devise and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that—
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with man-
agement’s general or specific authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with gen-
erally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and (II) to maintain ac-
countability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management’s general or specific authorization; and
(iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appro-
priate action is taken with respect to any differences; and
(C) notwithstanding any other provision of law, pay the al-
locable share of such issuer of a reasonable annual accounting
support fee or fees, determined in accordance with section 109
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
(3)(A) With respect to matters concerning the national security
of the United States, no duty or liability under paragraph (2) of
this subsection shall be imposed upon any person acting in coopera-
tion with the head of any Federal department or agency respon-
sible for such matters if such act in cooperation with such head of
a department or agency was done upon the specific, written direc-
tive of the head of such department or agency pursuant to Presi-
dential authority to issue such directives. Each directive issued
under this paragraph shall set forth the specific facts and cir-
cumstances with respect to which the provisions of this paragraph
are to be invoked. Each such directive shall, unless renewed in
writing, expire one year after the date of issuance.
(B) Each head of a Federal department or agency of the United
States who issues a directive pursuant to this paragraph shall
maintain a complete file of all such directives and shall, on October
1 of each year, transmit a summary of matters covered by such di-
rectives in force at any time during the previous year to the Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representa-

pursuant to section 12 of this title or an issuer which is required
to file reports pursuant to section 15(d) of this title holds 50 per
centum or less of the voting power with respect to a domestic or
foreign firm, the provisions of paragraph (2) require only that the
issuer proceed in good faith to use its influence, to the extent rea-
sonable under the issuer’s circumstances, to cause such domestic or
foreign firm to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting

the relative degree of the issuer’s ownership of the domestic or for-
eign firm and the laws and practices governing the business oper-
ations of the country in which such firm is located. An issuer which
demonstrates good faith efforts to use such influence shall be con-
clusively presumed to have complied with the requirements of
paragraph (2).
(7) For the purpose of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the
terms ‘‘reasonable assurances’’ and ‘‘reasonable detail’’ mean such
level of detail and degree of assurance as would satisfy prudent of-
ficials in the conduct of their own affairs.
(c) If in the judgment of the Commission any report required
under subsection (a) is inapplicable to any specified class or classes
of issuers, the Commission shall require in lieu thereof the submis-
sion of such reports of comparable character as it may deem appli-
cable to such class or classes of issuers.
(d)(1) Any person who, after acquiring directly or indirectly the
beneficial ownership of any equity security of a class which is reg-
istered pursuant to section 12 of this title, or any equity security
of an insurance company which would have been required to be so
registered except for the exemption contained in section 12(g)(2)(G)
of this title, or any equity security issued by a closed-end invest-
ment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 or any equity security issued by a Native Corporation pursu-
ant to section 37(d)(6) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act,
or otherwise becomes or is deemed to become a beneficial owner of
any of the foregoing upon the purchase or sale of a security-based
swap that the Commission may define by rule, and is directly or
indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 5 per centum of such
class shall, within ten days after such acquisition or within such
shorter time as the Commission may establish by rule, file with the
Commission, a statement containing such of the following informa-
tion, and such additional information, as the Commission may by
rules and regulations, prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors—

ship of, and the nature of such beneficial ownership by, such
person and all other persons by whom or on whose behalf the

security, a description of the transaction and the names of the
parties thereto, except that where a source of funds is a loan
made in the ordinary course of business by a bank, as defined
in section 3(a)(6) of this title, if the person filing such state-
ment so requests, the name of the bank shall not be made
available to the public;

of profits, division of losses or profits, or the giving or with-
holding of proxies, naming the persons with whom such con-
tracts, arrangements, or understandings have been entered
into, and giving the details thereof.
(2) If any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the
statement filed with the Commission, an amendment shall be filed
with the Commission, in accordance with such rules and regula-
tions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(3) When two or more persons act as a partnership, limited
partnership, syndicate, or other group for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, or disposing of securities of an issuer, such syndicate or
group shall be deemed a ‘‘person’’ for the purposes of this sub-
section.

centage of a class of any security, such class shall be deemed to
consist of the amount of the outstanding securities of such class,
exclusive of any securities of such class held by or for the account
of the issuer or a subsidiary of the issuer.
(5) The Commission, by rule or regulation or by order, may
permit any person to file in lieu of the statement required by para-
graph (1) of this subsection or the rules and regulations there-
under, a notice stating the name of such person, the number of
shares of any equity securities subject to paragraph (1) which are
owned by him, the date of their acquisition and such other informa-
tion as the Commission may specify, if it appears to the Commis-
sion that such securities were acquired by such person in the ordi-
nary course of his business and were not acquired for the purpose
of and do not have the effect of changing or influencing the control
of the issuer nor in connection with or as a participant in any
transaction having such purpose or effect.
(6) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to—
(A) any acquisition or offer to acquire securities made or
proposed to be made by means of a registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933;
(B) any acquisition of the beneficial ownership of a security
which, together with all other acquisitions by the same person
of securities of the same class during the preceding twelve

which the Commission, by rules or regulations or by order,
shall exempt from the provisions of this subsection as not en-
tered into for the purpose of, and not having the effect of,
changing or influencing the control of the issuer or otherwise
as not comprehended within the purposes of this subsection.
(e)(1) It shall be unlawful for an issuer which has a class of
equity securities registered pursuant to section 12 of this title, or
which is a closed-end investment company registered under the In-
vestment Company Act of 1940, to purchase any equity security
issued by it if such purchase is in contravention of such rules and
regulations as the Commission, in the public interest or for the pro-
tection of investors, may adopt (A) to define acts and practices
which are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative, and (B) to pre-
scribe means reasonably designed to prevent such acts and prac-
tices. Such rules and regulations may require such issuer to pro-
vide holders of equity securities of such class with such information
relating to the reasons for such purchase, the source of funds, the
number of shares to be purchased, the price to be paid for such se-
curities, the method of purchase, and such additional information,
as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public in-
terest or for the protection of investors, or which the Commission
deems to be material to a determination whether such security
should be sold.
(2) For the purpose of this subsection, a purchase by or for the
issuer or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the issuer, or a purchase subject to control of the
issuer or any such person, shall be deemed to be a purchase by the
issuer. The Commission shall have power to make rules and regu-
lations implementing this paragraph in the public interest and for
the protection of investors, including exemptive rules and regula-
tions covering situations in which the Commission deems it unnec-
essary or inappropriate that a purchase of the type described in
this paragraph shall be deemed to be a purchase by the issuer for
purposes of some or all of the provisions of paragraph (1) of this
subsection.
(3) At the time of filing such statement as the Commission may
require by rule pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the
person making the filing shall pay to the Commission a fee at a
rate that, subject to paragraph (4), is equal to $92 per $1,000,000
of the value of securities proposed to be purchased. The fee shall
be reduced with respect to securities in an amount equal to any fee
paid with respect to any securities issued in connection with the
proposed transaction under section 6(b) of the Securities Act of
1933, or the fee paid under that section shall be reduced in an
amount equal to the fee paid to the Commission in connection with
such transaction under this paragraph.
(4) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.—For each fiscal year, the Com-
mission shall by order adjust the rate required by paragraph
(3) for such fiscal year to a rate that is equal to the rate (ex-
pressed in dollars per million) that is applicable under section
6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 for such fiscal year.

ing day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least
$100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than
$10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file
reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and
at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by
rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for
periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter. Such re-
ports shall include for each such equity security held on the last
day of the reporting period by accounts (in aggregate or by type as
the Commission, by rule, may prescribe) with respect to which the
institutional investment manager exercises investment discretion
(other than securities held in amounts which the Commission, by
rule, determines to be insignificant for purposes of this subsection),

the public disclosure of the name of the issuer and the title,
class, CUSIP number, aggregate amount of the number of
short sales of each security, and any additional information de-
termined by the Commission following the end of the reporting
period. At a minimum, such public disclosure shall occur every
month.

tionally or unconditionally, any institutional investment manager
or security or any class of institutional investment managers or se-
curities from any or all of the provisions of this subsection or the
rules thereunder.

reasonable fee a list of all equity securities of a class described in
section 13(d)(1) of this title, updated no less frequently than reports
are required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this sub-
section. The Commission shall tabulate the information contained
in any report filed pursuant to this subsection in a manner which
will, in the view of the Commission, maximize the usefulness of the
information to other Federal and State authorities and the public.
Promptly after the filing of any such report, the Commission shall

such information in accordance with section 552 of title 5, United
States Code. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such in-
formation identifying the securities held by the account of a nat-
ural person or an estate or trust (other than a business trust or
investment company) shall not be disclosed to the public.
(5) In exercising its authority under this subsection, the Com-
mission shall determine (and so state) that its action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of inves-
tors or to maintain fair and orderly markets or, in granting an ex-
emption, that its action is consistent with the protection of inves-
tors and the purposes of this subsection. In exercising such author-
ity the Commission shall take such steps as are within its power,
including consulting with the Comptroller General of the United
States, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the
appropriate regulatory agencies, Federal and State authorities
which, directly or indirectly, require reports from institutional in-
vestment managers of information substantially similar to that
called for by this subsection, national securities exchanges, and
registered securities associations, (A) to achieve uniform, central-
ized reporting of information concerning the securities holdings of
and transactions by or for accounts with respect to which institu-
tional investment managers exercise investment discretion, and (B)
consistently with the objective set forth in the preceding subpara-
graph, to avoid unnecessarily duplicative reporting by, and mini-
mize the compliance burden on, institutional investment managers.
Federal authorities which, directly or indirectly, require reports
from institutional investment managers of information substan-
tially similar to that called for by this subsection shall cooperate
with the Commission in the performance of its responsibilities
under the preceding sentence. An institutional investment manager
which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance
with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, shall file with the appro-
priate regulatory agency a copy of every report filed with the Com-
mission pursuant to this subsection.
(6)(A) For purposes of this subsection the term ‘‘institutional
investment manager’’ includes any person, other than a natural
person, investing in or buying and selling securities for its own ac-
count, and any person exercising investment discretion with re-
spect to the account of any other person.
(B) The Commission shall adopt such rules as it deems nec-
essary or appropriate to prevent duplicative reporting pursuant to
this subsection by two or more institutional investment managers
exercising investment discretion with respect to the same amount.

centage of a class of any security, such class shall be deemed to
consist of the amount of the outstanding securities of such class,
exclusive of any securities of such class held by or for the account
of the issuer or a subsidiary of the issuer.

the compliance burden on persons required to report, and (C) to

markets of securities transactions involving a substantial vol-
ume or a large fair market value or exercise value and for the
purpose of otherwise assisting the Commission in the enforce-
ment of this title, each large trader shall—
(A) provide such information to the Commission as the
Commission may by rule or regulation prescribe as nec-
essary or appropriate, identifying such large trader and all
accounts in or through which such large trader effects such
transactions; and
(B) identify, in accordance with such rules or regula-
tions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or ap-
propriate, to any registered broker or dealer by or through
whom such large trader directly or indirectly effects securi-
ties transactions, such large trader and all accounts di-
rectly or indirectly maintained with such broker or dealer
by such large trader in or through which such transactions
are effected.

contracted to be manufactured that are not DRC con-
flict free (‘‘DRC conflict free’’ is defined to mean the

ments of the regulations promulgated under subparagraph

graph, a product may be labeled as ‘‘DRC conflict free’’ if
the product does not contain conflict minerals that directly

should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the
grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for
hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred twenty
days of the date of the filing of the application for registration.
At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Commission, by
order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission
may extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up
to ninety days if it finds good cause for such extension and
publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as
to which the applicant consents.
The Commission shall grant such registration if the Commission
finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied. The order
granting registration shall not be effective until such broker or
dealer has become a member of a registered securities association,
or until such broker or dealer has become a member of a national
securities exchange, if such broker or dealer effects transactions
solely on that exchange, unless the Commission has exempted such
broker or dealer, by rule or order, from such membership. The
Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such
a finding or if it finds that if the applicant were so registered, its
registration would be subject to suspension or revocation under
paragraph (4) of this subsection.
(2)(A) An application for registration of a broker or dealer to
be formed or organized may be made by a broker or dealer to which
the broker or dealer to be formed or organized is to be the suc-
cessor. Such application, in such form as the Commission, by rule,
may prescribe, shall contain such information and documents con-
cerning the applicant, the successor, and any persons associated
with the applicant or the successor, as the Commission, by rule,
may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors. The grant or denial of registration
to such an applicant shall be in accordance with the procedures set
forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the Commission grants
such registration, the registration shall terminate on the forty-fifth
day after the effective date thereof, unless prior thereto the suc-
cessor shall, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the
Commission may prescribe, adopt the application for registration
as its own.
(B) Any person who is a broker or dealer solely by reason of
acting as a municipal securities dealer or municipal securities
broker, who so acts through a separately identifiable department or
division, and who so acted in such a manner on the date of enact-

such department or division is so registered, the department or di-
vision and not such person himself shall be the broker or dealer for
purposes of this title.
(C) Within six months of the date of the granting of registra-
tion to a broker or dealer, the Commission, or upon the authoriza-
tion and direction of the Commission, a registered securities asso-
ciation or national securities exchange of which such broker or
dealer is a member, shall conduct an inspection of the broker or
dealer to determine whether it is operating in conformity with the
provisions of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder:
Provided, however, That the Commission may delay such inspection
of any class of brokers or dealers for a period not to exceed six
months.
(3) Any provision of this title (other than section 5 and sub-
section (a) of this section) which prohibits any act, practice, or
course of business if the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce is used in connection therewith shall also pro-
hibit any such act, practice, or course of business by any registered
broker or dealer or any person acting on behalf of such a broker
or dealer, irrespective of any use of the mails or any means or in-
strumentality of interstate commerce in connection therewith.
(4) The Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations
on the activities, functions, or operations of, suspend for a period
not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of any
broker or dealer if it finds, on the record after notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, sus-
pension, or revocation is in the public interest and that such broker

(ii) constitutes a final order based on violations of any
laws or regulations that prohibit fraudulent, manipulative,

(5) Pending final determination whether any registration
under this subsection shall be revoked, the Commission, by order,
may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the
Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors. Any registered broker or dealer may, upon such terms
and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors, withdraw
from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the
Commission. If the Commission finds that any registered broker or
dealer is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a
broker or dealer, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the reg-
istration of such broker or dealer.
(6)(A) With respect to any person who is associated, who is
seeking to become associated, or, at the time of the alleged mis-
conduct, who was associated or was seeking to become associated
with a broker or dealer, or any person participating, or, at the time
of the alleged misconduct, who was participating, in an offering of
any penny stock, the Commission, by order, shall censure, place
limitations on the activities or functions of such person, or suspend
for a period not exceeding 12 months, or bar any such person from
being associated with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, munic-
ipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nation-
ally recognized statistical rating organization, or from participating
in an offering of penny stock, if the Commission finds, on the
record after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that such cen-

terest and that such person—

willfully to become, or to be, associated with a broker or dealer
in contravention of such order, or to participate in an offering

(ii) for any broker or dealer to permit such a person, with-
out the consent of the Commission, to become or remain, a per-
son associated with the broker or dealer in contravention of
such order, if such broker or dealer knew, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should have known, of such order; or

out the consent of the Commission, to participate in an offering
of penny stock in contravention of such order, if such broker
or dealer knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should

pating in an offering of penny stock’’ includes any person acting as
any promoter, finder, consultant, agent, or other person who en-
gages in activities with a broker, dealer, or issuer for purposes of
the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempt-
ing to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. The Commis-
sion may, by rule or regulation, define such term to include other
activities, and may, by rule, regulation, or order, exempt any per-
son or class of persons, in whole or in part, conditionally or uncon-
ditionally, from such term.

broker or dealer meet such standards of training, experience, com-
petence, and such other qualifications as the Commission finds nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors. The Commission shall establish such standards by rules

(A) specify that all or any portion of such standards shall
be applicable to any class of brokers and dealers and persons
associated with brokers and dealers;
(B) require persons in any such class to pass tests pre-
scribed in accordance with such rules and regulations, which
tests shall, with respect to any class of partners, officers, or su-
pervisory employees (which latter term may be defined by the
Commission’s rules and regulations and as so defined shall in-

other appropriate matters; and

its direction. The Commission may cooperate with registered secu-

and administering tests and may require registered brokers and
dealers and persons associated with such brokers and dealers to
pass tests administered by or on behalf of any such association or
exchange and to pay such association or exchange reasonable fees
or charges to defray the costs incurred by such association or ex-
change in administering such tests.

chase or sale of, any security (other than or 19 commercial paper,
bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills), unless such broker or
dealer is a member of a securities association registered pursuant

with the public interest and the protection of investors, may condi-
tionally or unconditionally exempt from paragraph (8) of this sub-
section any broker or dealer or class of brokers or dealers specified
in such rule or order.

an exemption granted by the Commission under section 36
of this title or pursuant to a rule or regulation, cash and
securities may be held by a broker or dealer registered
pursuant to subsection (b)(1) and also registered as a fu-
tures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(1) of
the Commodity Exchange Act, in a portfolio margining ac-
count carried as a futures account subject to section 4d of
the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regula-
tions thereunder, pursuant to a portfolio margining pro-
gram approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Com-

14, or subsection (d) of section 15 of this title or any rule or regula-
tion thereunder has failed to comply with any such provision, rule,
or regulation in any material respect, the Commission may publish
its findings and issue an order requiring such person, and any per-
son who was a cause of the failure to comply due to an act or omis-
sion the person knew or should have known would contribute to
the failure to comply, to comply, or to take steps to effect compli-
ance, with such provision or such rule or regulation thereunder

thorize the Commission to prescribe rules or regulations for such

(j) RULEMAKING TO EXTEND REQUIREMENTS TO NEW HYBRID
PRODUCTS.—
(1) CONSULTATION.—Prior to commencing a rulemaking
under this subsection, the Commission shall consult with and
seek the concurrence of the Board concerning the imposition of
broker or dealer registration requirements with respect to any
new hybrid product. In developing and promulgating rules
under this subsection, the Commission shall consider the views
of the Board, including views with respect to the nature of the
new hybrid product; the history, purpose, extent, and appro-
priateness of the regulation of the new product under the Fed-
eral banking laws; and the impact of the proposed rule on the
banking industry.
(2) LIMITATION.—The Commission shall not—
(A) require a bank to register as a broker or dealer
under this section because the bank engages in any trans-
action in, or buys or sells, a new hybrid product; or

(B) bring an action against a bank for a failure to com-
ply with a requirement described in subparagraph (A),
unless the Commission has imposed such requirement by rule
or regulation issued in accordance with this section.
(3) CRITERIA FOR RULEMAKING.—The Commission shall not
impose a requirement under paragraph (2) of this subsection
with respect to any new hybrid product unless the Commission
determines that—
(A) the new hybrid product is a security; and
(B) imposing such requirement is necessary and ap-
propriate in the public interest and for the protection of in-
vestors.
(4) CONSIDERATIONS.—In making a determination under
paragraph (3), the Commission shall consider—
(A) the nature of the new hybrid product; and
(B) the history, purpose, extent, and appropriateness
of the regulation of the new hybrid product under the Fed-
eral securities laws and under the Federal banking laws.
(5) O BJECTION TO COMMISSION REGULATION.—
(A) FILING OF PETITION FOR REVIEW.—The Board may
obtain review of any final regulation described in para-
graph (2) in the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit by filing in such court, not
later than 60 days after the date of publication of the final
regulation, a written petition requesting that the regula-
tion be set aside. Any proceeding to challenge any such
rule shall be expedited by the Court of Appeals.
(B) TRANSMITTAL OF PETITION AND RECORD.—A copy of
a petition described in subparagraph (A) shall be trans-
mitted as soon as possible by the Clerk of the Court to an
officer or employee of the Commission designated for that
purpose. Upon receipt of the petition, the Commission
shall file with the court the regulation under review and
any documents referred to therein, and any other relevant
materials prescribed by the court.
(C) EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.—On the date of the fil-
ing of the petition under subparagraph (A), the court has
jurisdiction, which becomes exclusive on the filing of the
materials set forth in subparagraph (B), to affirm and en-
force or to set aside the regulation at issue.
(D) STANDARD OF REVIEW.—The court shall determine
to affirm and enforce or set aside a regulation of the Com-
mission under this subsection, based on the determination
of the court as to whether—
(i) the subject product is a new hybrid product, as
defined in this subsection;
(ii) the subject product is a security; and
(iii) imposing a requirement to register as a
broker or dealer for banks engaging in transactions in
such product is appropriate in light of the history, pur-
pose, and extent of regulation under the Federal secu-
rities laws and under the Federal banking laws, giving
deference neither to the views of the Commission nor
the Board.

making under this subsection pursuant to section 25 of

product’’ means a product that—
(i) was not subjected to regulation by the Commis-
sion as a security prior to the date of the enactment
of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;
(ii) is not an identified banking product as such
term is defined in section 206 of such Act; and

(k) REGISTRATION OR SUCCESSION TO A UNITED STATES BROKER
OR DEALER.—In determining whether to permit a foreign person or
an affiliate of a foreign person to register as a United States broker
or dealer, or succeed to the registration of a United States broker
or dealer, the Commission may consider whether, for a foreign per-
son, or an affiliate of a foreign person that presents a risk to the
stability of the United States financial system, the home country
of the foreign person has adopted, or made demonstrable progress
toward adopting, an appropriate system of financial regulation to
mitigate such risk.
(l) TERMINATION OF A UNITED STATES BROKER OR DEALER.—
For a foreign person or an affiliate of a foreign person that presents
such a risk to the stability of the United States financial system,
the Commission may determine to terminate the registration of
such foreign person or an affiliate of such foreign person as a
broker or dealer in the United States, if the Commission deter-
mines that the home country of the foreign person has not adopted,
or made demonstrable progress toward adopting, an appropriate
system of financial regulation to mitigate such risk.
(k) 23 STANDARD OF CONDUCT.—

sion may promulgate rules to provide that, with respect to a
broker or dealer, when providing personalized investment ad-

vice about securities to a retail customer (and such other cus-
tomers as the Commission may by rule provide), the standard
of conduct for such broker or dealer with respect to such cus-
tomer shall be the same as the standard of conduct applicable
to an investment adviser under section 211 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. The receipt of compensation based on
commission or other standard compensation for the sale of se-
curities shall not, in and of itself, be considered a violation of
such standard applied to a broker or dealer. Nothing in this
section shall require a broker or dealer or registered represent-
ative to have a continuing duty of care or loyalty to the cus-
tomer after providing personalized investment advice about se-
curities.
(2) DISCLOSURE OF RANGE OF PRODUCTS OFFERED.—Where
a broker or dealer sells only proprietary or other limited range
of products, as determined by the Commission, the Commission
may by rule require that such broker or dealer provide notice
to each retail customer and obtain the consent or acknowledg-
ment of the customer. The sale of only proprietary or other lim-
ited range of products by a broker or dealer shall not, in and
of itself, be considered a violation of the standard set forth in
paragraph (1).
(l) OTHER MATTERS.—The Commission shall—
(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear disclosures
to investors regarding the terms of their relationships with
brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, including any mate-
rial conflicts of interest; and
(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules pro-
hibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of inter-
est, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and in-
vestment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the
public interest and the protection of investors.
(m) HARMONIZATION OF ENFORCEMENT.—The enforcement au-
thority of the Commission with respect to violations of the standard
of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing personalized
investment advice about securities to a retail customer shall in-
clude— (1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with re-
spect to such violations provided under this Act; and
(2) the enforcement authority of the Commission with re-
spect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to an
investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
including the authority to impose sanctions for such violations,
and
the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of
the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing
personalized investment advice about securities to a retail cus-
tomer under this Act to same extent as the Commission prosecutes
and sanctions violators of the standard of conduct applicable to an
investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

nating documents or information that shall be provided by a

investment product or service by the retail investor.
(2) CONSIDERATIONS.—In developing any rules under para-
graph (1), the Commission shall consider whether the rules
will promote investor protection, efficiency, competition, and
capital formation.
(3) FORM AND CONTENTS OF DOCUMENTS AND INFORMA-
TION.—Any documents or information designated under a rule
promulgated under paragraph (1) shall—
(A) be in a summary format; and
(B) contain clear and concise information about—
(i) investment objectives, strategies, costs, and
risks; and
(ii) any compensation or other financial incentive
received by a broker, dealer, or other intermediary in
connection with the purchase of retail investment
products.
(o) AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT MANDATORY PRE- DISPUTE ARBITRA-
TION.—The Commission, by rule, may prohibit, or impose condi-
tions or limitations on the use of, agreements that require cus-
tomers or clients of any broker, dealer, or municipal securities deal-
er to arbitrate any future dispute between them arising under the
Federal securities laws, the rules and regulations thereunder, or
the rules of a self-regulatory organization if it finds that such pro-
hibition, imposition of conditions, or limitations are in the public
interest and for the protection of investors.

nation between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, to fix
minimum profits, to impose any schedule or fix rates of com-
missions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by
its members, or to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred
by this title matters not related to the purposes of this title or
the administration of the association.

of the type authorized by paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of this
section shall not be less stringent than in the case of the na-
tional securities association with which such association is to
be affiliated.
(e)(1) The rules of a registered securities association may pro-
vide that no member thereof shall deal with any nonmember pro-
fessional (as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection) except at
the same prices, for the same commissions or fees, and on the same
terms and conditions as are by such member accorded to the gen-
eral public.
(2) For the purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘nonmember
professional’’ shall include (A) with respect to transactions in secu-

association.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be so construed or applied
as to prevent (A) any member of any registered securities associa-
tion from granting to any other member of any registered securities
association any dealer’s discount, allowance, commission, or special
terms, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, or (B)
any member of a registered securities association or any municipal
securities dealer which is a bank or a division or department of a
bank from granting to any member of any registered securities as-
sociation or any such municipal securities dealer any dealer’s dis-
count, allowance, commission, or special terms in connection with
the purchase or sale of municipal securities: Provided, however,
That the granting of any such discount, allowance, commission, or
special terms in connection with the purchase or sale of municipal
securities shall be subject to rules of the Municipal Securities Rule-

rules concerning any transaction by a registered broker or dealer
in a municipal security.
(g)(1) A registered securities association shall deny member-
ship to any person who is not a registered broker or dealer.
(2) A registered securities association may, and in cases in
which the Commission, by order, directs as necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors shall,
deny membership to any registered broker or dealer, and bar from
becoming associated with a member any person, who is subject to
a statutory disqualification. A registered securities association shall
file notice with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to
admitting any registered broker or dealer to membership or permit-
ting any person to become associated with a member, if the associa-
tion knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,
that such broker or dealer or person was subject to a statutory dis-
qualification. The notice shall be in such form and contain such in-
formation as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary
or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of inves-
tors.(3)(A) A registered securities association may deny member-
ship to, or condition the membership of, a registered broker or deal-
er if (i) such broker or dealer does not meet such standards of fi-
nancial responsibility or operational capability or such broker or
dealer or any natural person associated with such broker or dealer
does not meet such standards of training, experience, and com-
petence as are prescribed by the rules of the association or (ii) such
broker or dealer or person associated with such broker or dealer
has engaged and there is a reasonable likelihood he will again en-
gage in acts or practices inconsistent with just and equitable prin-
ciples of trade. A registered securities association may examine and
verify the qualifications of an applicant to become a member and
the natural persons associated with such an applicant in accord-
ance with procedures established by the rules of the association.
(B) A registered securities association may bar a natural per-
son from becoming associated with a member or condition the asso-
ciation of a natural person with a member if such natural person
(i) does not meet such standards of training, experience, and com-
petence as are prescribed by the rules of the association or (ii) has
engaged and there is a reasonable likelihood he will again engage
in acts or practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles
of trade. A registered securities association may examine and verify
the qualifications of an applicant to become a person associated
with a member in accordance with procedures established by the
rules of the association and require a natural person associated
with a member, or any class of such natural persons, to be reg-
istered with the association in accordance with procedures so estab-
lished.
(C) A registered securities association may bar any person
from becoming associated with a member if such person does not
agree (i) to supply the association with such information with re-
spect to its relationship and dealings with the member as may be
specified in the rules of the association and (ii) to permit examina-
tion of its books and records to verify the accuracy of any informa-
tion so supplied.

deny membership to or condition the membership of, or bar any
person from becoming associated with or condition the association
of any person with, a broker or dealer that engages exclusively in
transactions in municipal securities.
(4) A registered securities association may deny membership to
a registered broker or dealer not engaged in a type of business in
which the rules of the association require members to be engaged:
Provided, however, That no registered securities association may
deny membership to a registered broker or dealer by reason of the
amount of such type of business done by such broker or dealer or
the other types of business in which he is engaged.
(h)(1) In any proceeding by a registered securities association
to determine whether a member or person associated with a mem-
ber should be disciplined (other than a summary proceeding pursu-
ant to paragraph (3) of this subsection) the association shall bring
specific charges, notify such member or person of, and give him an
opportunity to defend against, such charges, and keep a record. A
determination by the association to impose a disciplinary sanction
shall be supported by a statement setting forth—
(A) any act or practice in which such member or person as-
sociated with a member has been found to have engaged, or
which such member or person has been found to have omitted;
(B) the specific provision of this title, the rules or regula-
tions thereunder, the rules of the Municipal Securities Rule-
making Board, or the rules of the association which any such
act or practice, or omission to act, is deemed to violate; and

determine whether a person shall be denied membership, barred
from becoming associated with a member, or prohibited or limited

paragraph (3) of this subsection), the association shall notify such
person of and give him an opportunity to be heard upon, the spe-
cific grounds for denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation under con-
sideration and keep a record. A determination by the association to
deny membership, bar a person from becoming associated with a

which the denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation is based.

or barred or suspended from being associated with a member of
any self-regulatory organization, (B) suspend a member who is in
such financial or operating difficulty that the association deter-
mines and so notifies the Commission that the member cannot be
permitted to continue to do business as a member with safety to
investors, creditors, other members, or the association, or (C) limit

sociation. Any person aggrieved by any such summary action shall
be promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the associa-
tion in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this
subsection. The Commission, by order, may stay any such summary
action on its own motion or upon application by any person ag-
grieved thereby, if the Commission determines summarily or after
notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist sole-
ly of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments)
that such stay is consistent with the public interest and the protec-
tion of investors.

inserting ‘‘or municipal advisor’’ after ‘‘municipal securities dealer or obligated person’’ each
place that term appears. The amendment was not executed because the phrase does not appear.
(2) The Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations
on the activities, functions, or operations, suspend for a period not
exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of any munic-
ipal securities dealer or municipal advisor, if it finds, on the record
after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing
of limitations, denial, suspension, or revocation, is in the public in-
terest and that such municipal securities dealer or municipal advi-
sor has committed or omitted any act, or is subject to an order or
finding, enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), (H), or (G) of
paragraph (4) of section 15(b) of this title, has been convicted of

under this section shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may
suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Com-
mission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary
or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of inves-
tors or municipal entities or obligated person. Any registered mu-
nicipal securities dealer or municipal advisor may, upon such terms
and conditions as the Commission may deem necessary in the pub-
lic interest or for the protection of investors or municipal entities
or obligated person, withdraw from registration by filing a written
notice of withdrawal with the Commission. If the Commission finds
that any registered municipal securities dealer or municipal advi-
sor is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a mu-
nicipal securities dealer or municipal advisor, the Commission, by
order, shall cancel the registration of such municipal securities
dealer or municipal advisor.

ties dealer, or suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months or bar
any such person from being associated with a broker, dealer, in-
vestment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor,
transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organiza-
tion, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, sus-
pension, or bar is in the public interest and that such person has
committed any act, or is subject to an order or finding, enumerated
in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), (H), or (G) of paragraph (4) of section
15(b) of this title, has been convicted of any offense specified in

the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency, the ap-
propriate regulatory agency for such municipal securities dealer

U.S.C. 1818), enforce compliance by such municipal securities deal-
er or any person associated with such municipal securities dealer
with the provisions of this section, section 17 of this title, the rules
of the Board, and the rules of the Commission pertaining to munic-
ipal securities dealers, persons associated with municipal securities
dealers, and transactions in municipal securities. For purposes of
the preceding sentence, any violation of any such provision shall
constitute adequate basis for the issuance of any order under sec-

tomers of any such municipal securities dealer shall be deemed to

the powers of such appropriate regulatory agency to proceed
against such municipal securities dealer under any other provision
of law.

ject to such limitations as the Commission, by rule, determines to

or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction
in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any
government security unless such government securities broker or

broker or government securities dealer. When such a government
securities broker or government securities dealer ceases to act as
such it shall file with the appropriate regulatory agency a written

curities dealer that is a registered broker or dealer and any per-
sons associated with such government securities broker or govern-
ment securities dealer as the Commission shall, by rule, prescribe
as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protec-
tion of investors.
(iii) Each appropriate regulatory agency (other than the Com-
mission) shall make available to the Commission the notices which
have been filed with it under this subparagraph, and the Commis-
sion shall maintain and make available to the public such notices
and the notices it receives under this subparagraph.
(2) A government securities broker or a government securities
dealer subject to the registration requirement of paragraph (1)(A)
of this subsection may be registered by filing with the Commission
an application for registration in such form and containing such in-
formation and documents concerning such government securities
broker or government securities dealer and any persons associated
with such government securities broker or government securities
dealer as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
Within 45 days of the date of filing of such application (or within
such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Com-
mission shall—
(A) by order grant registration, or
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration
should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the
grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for
hearing and shall be concluded within 120 days of the date of
the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion
of such proceedings, the Commission, by order, shall grant or
deny such registration. The Commission may extend the time
for the conclusion of such proceedings for up to 90 days if it
finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons
for so finding or for such longer period as to which the appli-
cant consents.
The Commission shall grant the registration of a government secu-
rities broker or a government securities dealer if the Commission
finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied. The order
granting registration shall not be effective until such government
securities broker or government securities dealer has become a
member of a national securities exchange registered under section
6 of this title, or a securities association registered under section
15A of this title, unless the Commission has exempted such govern-
ment securities broker or government securities dealer, by rule or
order, from such membership. The Commission shall deny such
registration if it does not make such a finding or if it finds that
if the applicant were so registered, its registration would be subject
to suspension or revocation under subsection (c) of this section.
(3) Any provision of this title (other than section 5 or para-
graph (1) of this subsection) which prohibits any act, practice, or
course of business if the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce is used in connection therewith shall also pro-
hibit any such act, practice, or course of business by any govern-
ment securities broker or government securities dealer registered

dealer that is required to register under paragraph (1)(A) and that

rules as the Commission shall prescribe pursuant to this subsection
to assure that its customers receive complete, accurate, and timely
disclosure of the inapplicability of Securities Investor Protection
Corporation coverage to their accounts.
(5) The Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter in this section
referred to as the ‘‘Secretary’’), by rule or order, upon the Sec-
retary’s own motion or upon application, may conditionally or un-
conditionally exempt any government securities broker or govern-
ment securities dealer, or class of government securities brokers or
government securities dealers, from any provision of subsection (a),
(b), or (d) of this section, other than subsection (d)(3), or the rules
thereunder, if the Secretary finds that such exemption is consistent
with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the pur-
poses of this title.
(b)(1) The Secretary shall propose and adopt rules to effect the
purposes of this title with respect to transactions in government se-
curities effected by government securities brokers and government
securities dealers as follows:
(A) Such rules shall provide safeguards with respect to the
financial responsibility and related practices of government se-
curities brokers and government securities dealers including,
but not limited to, capital adequacy standards, the acceptance
of custody and use of customers’ securities, the carrying and
use of customers’ deposits or credit balances, and the transfer
and control of government securities subject to repurchase
agreements and in similar transactions.
(B) Such rules shall require every government securities
broker and government securities dealer to make reports to
and furnish copies of records to the appropriate regulatory
agency, and to file with the appropriate regulatory agency, an-
nually or more frequently, a balance sheet and income state-
ment certified by an independent public accountant, prepared
on a calendar or fiscal year basis, and such other financial
statements (which shall, as the Secretary specifies, be certified)
and information concerning its financial condition as required
by such rules.
(C) Such rules shall require records to be made and kept
by government securities brokers and government securities
dealers and shall specify the periods for which such records

istered person’s policies, procedures, or systems for monitoring
and controlling financial and operational risks to it resulting
from the activities of any of its associated persons, other than
a natural person. Such records shall describe, in the aggregate,
each of the financial and securities activities conducted by, and
customary sources of capital and funding of, those of its associ-
ated persons whose business activities are reasonably likely to
have a material impact on the financial or operational condi-
tion of such registered person, including its capital, its liquid-
ity, or its ability to conduct or finance its operations. The Sec-
retary, by rule, may require summary reports of such informa-
tion to be filed with the registered person’s appropriate regu-
latory agency no more frequently than quarterly.
(B) AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.—If,
as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports
provided pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or
other available information, the appropriate regulatory agency
reasonably concludes that it has concerns regarding the finan-
cial or operational condition of any government securities
broker or government securities dealer registered under this
section, such agency may require the registered person to
make reports concerning the financial and securities activities
of any of such person’s associated persons, other than a natural
person, whose business activities are reasonably likely to have
a material impact on the financial or operational condition of
such registered person. The appropriate regulatory agency, in
requiring reports pursuant to this subparagraph, shall specify
the information required, the period for which it is required,
the time and date on which the information must be furnished,
and whether the information is to be furnished directly to the
appropriate regulatory agency or to a self-regulatory organiza-
tion with primary responsibility for examining the registered
person’s financial and operational condition.
(C) SPECIAL PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO ASSOCIATED PER-
SONS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL BANKING AGENCY REGULATION.—
(i) COOPERATION IN IMPLEMENTATION.—In developing
and implementing reporting requirements pursuant to
subparagraph (A) of this paragraph with respect to associ-
ated persons subject to examination by or reporting re-
quirements of a Federal banking agency, the Secretary
shall consult with and consider the views of each such
Federal banking agency. If a Federal banking agency com-
ments in writing on a proposed rule of the Secretary under
this paragraph that has been published for comment, the
Secretary shall respond in writing to such written com-
ment before adopting the proposed rule. The Secretary
shall, at the request of a Federal banking agency, publish
such comment and response in the Federal Register at the
time of publishing the adopted rule.
(ii) USE OF BANKING AGENCY REPORTS.—A registered
government securities broker or government securities
dealer shall be in compliance with any recordkeeping or re-
porting requirement adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A)
of this paragraph concerning an associated person that is

subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a
Federal banking agency if such government securities
broker or government securities dealer utilizes for such
recordkeeping or reporting requirement copies of reports
filed by the associated person with the Federal banking
agency pursuant to section 5211 of the Revised Statutes,
section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act, section 7(a) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 10(b) of the Home

pany Act of 1956. The Secretary may, however, by rule
adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A), require any reg-
istered government securities broker or government securi-
ties dealer filing such reports with the appropriate regu-
latory agency to obtain, maintain, or report supplemental
information if the Secretary makes an explicit finding,
based on information provided by the appropriate regu-
latory agency, that such supplemental information is nec-
essary to inform the appropriate regulatory agency regard-
ing potential risks to such government securities broker or
government securities dealer. Prior to requiring any such
supplemental information, the Secretary shall first request
the Federal banking agency to expand its reporting re-
quirements to include such information.
(iii) PROCEDURE FOR REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMA-
TION.—Prior to making a request pursuant to subpara-
graph (B) of this paragraph for information with respect to
an associated person that is subject to examination by or
reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the
appropriate regulatory agency shall—
(I) notify such banking agency of the information
required with respect to such associated person; and
(II) consult with such agency to determine wheth-
er the information required is available from such
agency and for other purposes, unless the appropriate
regulatory agency determines that any delay resulting
from such consultation would be inconsistent with en-
suring the financial and operational condition of the
government securities broker or government securities
dealer or the stability or integrity of the securities
markets.
(iv) EXCLUSION FOR EXAMINATION REPORTS.—Nothing
in this subparagraph shall be construed to permit the Sec-
retary or an appropriate regulatory agency to require any
registered government securities broker or government se-
curities dealer to obtain, maintain, or furnish any exam-
ination report of any Federal banking agency or any super-
visory recommendations or analysis contained therein.
(v) CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED.—No
information provided to or obtained by an appropriate reg-
ulatory agency from any Federal banking agency pursuant
to a request under clause (iii) of this subparagraph regard-
ing any associated person which is subject to examination
by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency
may be disclosed to any other person (other than a self-

proval of the Federal banking agency. Nothing in this
clause shall authorize the Secretary or any appropriate
regulatory agency to withhold information from Congress,
or prevent the Secretary or any appropriate regulatory
agency from complying with a request for information from
any other Federal department or agency requesting the in-
formation for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction,
or complying with an order of a court of the United States
in an action brought by the United States or the Commis-
sion.(vi) NOTICE TO BANKING AGENCIES CONCERNING FINAN-
CIAL AND OPERATIONAL CONDITION CONCERNS.—The Sec-
retary or appropriate regulatory agency shall notify the
Federal banking agency of any concerns of the Secretary or
the appropriate regulatory agency regarding significant fi-
nancial or operational risks resulting from the activities of
any government securities broker or government securities
dealer to any associated person thereof which is subject to
examination by or reporting requirements of the Federal
banking agency.
(vii) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this subparagraph,
the term ‘‘Federal banking agency’’ shall have the same
meaning as the term ‘‘appropriate Federal banking agen-
cy’’ in section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12
U.S.C. 1813(q)).
(D) EXEMPTIONS.—The Secretary by rule or order may ex-
empt any person or class of persons, under such terms and
conditions and for such periods as the Secretary shall provide
in such rule or order, from the provisions of this paragraph,
and the rules thereunder. In granting such exemptions, the
Secretary shall consider, among other factors—
(i) whether information of the type required under this
paragraph is available from a supervisory agency (as de-
fined in section 1101(6) of the Right to Financial Privacy
Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401(6))), a State insurance com-
mission or similar State agency, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, or a similar foreign regulator;

(iii) the nature and extent of domestic or foreign regu-
lation of the associated person’s activities;

ated persons, on a consolidated basis, the amount and pro-
portion of assets devoted to, and revenues derived from,

of this paragraph concerning information with respect to asso-
ciated persons of government securities brokers and govern-
ment securities dealers who are also associated persons of reg-
istered brokers or dealers reporting to the Commission pursu-
ant to section 17(h) of this title, the requirements relating to

such associated persons shall conform, to the greatest extent
practicable, to the requirements under section 17(h).
(F) AUTHORITY TO LIMIT DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.—
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary and
any appropriate regulatory agency shall not be compelled to
disclose any information required to be reported under this
paragraph, or any information supplied to the Secretary or any
appropriate regulatory agency by any domestic or foreign regu-
latory agency that relates to the financial or operational condi-
tion of any associated person of a registered government secu-
rities broker or a government securities dealer. Nothing in this
paragraph shall authorize the Secretary or any appropriate
regulatory agency to withhold information from Congress, or
prevent the Secretary or any appropriate regulatory agency
from complying with a request for information from any other
Federal department or agency requesting the information for
purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or complying with
an order of a court of the United States in an action brought
by the United States or the Commission. For purposes of sec-
tion 552 of title 5, United States Code, this paragraph shall be
considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such
section 552.
(3)(A) With respect to any financial institution that has filed
notice as a government securities broker or government securities
dealer or that is required to file notice under subsection (a)(1)(B),
the appropriate regulatory agency for such government securities
broker or government securities dealer may issue such rules and
regulations with respect to transactions in government securities
as may be necessary to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade.
If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the appro-
priate regulatory agency, that such rule or regulation, if imple-
mented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity
or efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose
any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in further-
ance of the purposes of this section, the appropriate regulatory
agency shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule or regulation, find
that such rule or regulation is necessary and appropriate in fur-
therance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the Sec-
retary’s determination.
(B) The appropriate regulatory agency shall consult with and
consider the views of the Secretary prior to approving or amending
a rule or regulation under this paragraph, except where the appro-
priate regulatory agency determines that an emergency exists re-
quiring expeditious and summary action and publishes its reasons
therefor. If the Secretary comments in writing to the appropriate
regulatory agency on a proposed rule or regulation that has been
published for comment, the appropriate regulatory agency shall re-
spond in writing to such written comment before approving the
proposed rule or regulation.
(C) In promulgating rules under this section, the appropriate
regulatory agency shall consider the sufficiency and appropriate-
ness of then existing laws and rules applicable to government secu-
rities brokers, government securities dealers, and persons associ-

(4) Rules promulgated and orders issued under this section
shall—
(A) be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and to protect the integrity, liquidity, and
efficiency of the market for government securities, investors,
and the public interest; and
(B) not be designed to permit unfair discrimination be-
tween customers, issuers, government securities brokers, or
government securities dealers, or to impose any burden on
competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of this title.
(5) In promulgating rules and issuing orders under this sec-
tion, the Secretary—
(A) may appropriately classify government securities bro-
kers and government securities dealers (taking into account
relevant matters, including types of business done, nature of
securities other than government securities purchased or sold,
and character of business organization) and persons associated
with government securities brokers and government securities
dealers;
(B) may determine, to the extent consistent with para-
graph (2) of this subsection and with the public interest, the
protection of investors, and the purposes of this title, not to
apply, in whole or in part, certain rules under this section, or
to apply greater, lesser, or different standards, to certain class-
es of government securities brokers, government securities
dealers, or persons associated with government securities bro-
kers or government securities dealers;
(C) shall consider the sufficiency and appropriateness of
then existing laws and rules applicable to government securi-
ties brokers, government securities dealers, and persons associ-
ated with government securities brokers and government secu-
rities dealers; and
(D) shall consult with and consider the views of the Com-
mission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, except where the Secretary determines that an emer-
gency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and pub-
lishes its reasons for such determination.
(6) If the Commission or the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System comments in writing on a proposed rule of the Sec-
retary that has been published for comment, the Secretary shall re-
spond in writing to such written comment before approving the
proposed rule.
(7) No government securities broker or government securities
dealer shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality
of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or
attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any government security
in contravention of any rule under this section.

a period not exceeding 12 months, or revoke the registration of
such government securities broker or government securities
dealer, if it finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for

any government securities broker or government securities
dealer shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may sus-
pend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Com-
mission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protec-
tion of investors. Any registered government securities broker
or registered government securities dealer may, upon such
terms and conditions as the Commission may deem necessary
in the public interest or for the protection of investors, with-
draw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal
with the Commission. If the Commission finds that any reg-
istered government securities broker or registered government
securities dealer is no longer in existence or has ceased to do
business as a government securities broker or government se-
curities dealer, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the reg-
istration of such government securities broker or government
securities dealer.

tations on the activities or functions of any person who is, or

securities broker or government securities dealer is in effect will-
fully to become, or to be, associated with a government securities
broker or government securities dealer without the consent of the
appropriate regulatory agency, and it shall be unlawful for any gov-
ernment securities broker or government securities dealer to per-
mit such a person to become, or remain, a person associated with
it without the consent of the appropriate regulatory agency, if such
government securities broker or government securities dealer
knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of
such order.
(d)(1) All records of a government securities broker or govern-
ment securities dealer are subject at any time, or from time to
time, to such reasonable periodic, special, or other examinations by
representatives of the appropriate regulatory agency for such gov-
ernment securities broker or government securities dealer as such
appropriate regulatory agency deems necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in
furtherance of the purposes of this title.
(2) Information received by an appropriate regulatory agency,
the Secretary, or the Commission from or with respect to any gov-
ernment securities broker, government securities dealer, any per-
son associated with a government securities broker or government
securities dealer, or any other person subject to this section or

mission, any appropriate regulatory agency, any self-regulatory or-
ganization, or any Federal Reserve Bank.
(3) GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TRADE RECONSTRUCTION.—
(A) FURNISHING RECORDS.—Every government securities
broker and government securities dealer shall furnish to the
Commission on request such records of government securities
transactions, including records of the date and time of execu-
tion of trades, as the Commission may require to reconstruct
trading in the course of a particular inquiry or investigation
being conducted by the Commission for enforcement or surveil-
lance purposes. In requiring information pursuant to this para-
graph, the Commission shall specify the information required,
the period for which it is required, the time and date on which
the information must be furnished, and whether the informa-
tion is to be furnished directly to the Commission, to the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of New York, or to an appropriate regu-
latory agency or self-regulatory organization with responsi-
bility for examining the government securities broker or gov-
ernment securities dealer. The Commission may require that
such information be furnished in machine readable form not-
withstanding any limitation in subparagraph (B). In utilizing
its authority to require information in machine readable form,
the Commission shall minimize the burden such requirement
may place on small government securities brokers and dealers.
(B) LIMITATION; CONSTRUCTION.—The Commission shall
not utilize its authority under this paragraph to develop reg-
ular reporting requirements, except that the Commission may
require information to be furnished under this paragraph as

ernment securities dealer to obtain or maintain any informa-
tion for purposes of this paragraph which is not otherwise
maintained by such broker or dealer in accordance with any
other provision of law or usual and customary business prac-
tice. The Commission shall, where feasible, avoid requiring any
information to be furnished under this paragraph that the
Commission may obtain from the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
(C) PROCEDURES FOR REQUIRING INFORMATION.—At the
time the Commission requests any information pursuant to
subparagraph (A) with respect to any government securities
broker or government securities dealer for which the Commis-

ment securities broker or government securities dealer and,
upon request, furnish to the appropriate regulatory agency any
information supplied to the Commission.
(D) CONSULTATION.—Within 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this paragraph, and annually thereafter, or upon
the request of any other appropriate regulatory agency, the
Commission shall consult with the other appropriate regu-
latory agencies to determine the availability of records that
may be required to be furnished under this paragraph and, for
those records available directly from the other appropriate reg-
ulatory agencies, to develop a procedure for furnishing such
records expeditiously upon the Commission’s request.
(E) EXCLUSION FOR EXAMINATION REPORTS.—Nothing in
this paragraph shall be construed so as to permit the Commis-
sion to require any government securities broker or govern-
ment securities dealer to obtain, maintain, or furnish any ex-
amination report of any appropriate regulatory agency other
than the Commission or any supervisory recommendations or
analysis contained in any such examination report.
(F) AUTHORITY TO LIMIT DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.—
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission
and the appropriate regulatory agencies shall not be compelled
to disclose any information required or obtained under this
paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Com-
mission or any appropriate regulatory agency to withhold infor-
mation from Congress, or prevent the Commission or any ap-
propriate regulatory agency from complying with a request for
information from any other Federal department or agency re-
questing information for purposes within the scope of its juris-
diction, or from complying with an order of a court of the
United States in an action brought by the United States, the
Commission, or the appropriate regulatory agency. For pur-
poses of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, this sub-
paragraph shall be considered a statute described in subsection
(b)(3)(B) of such section 552.

association or national securities exchange, shall have adopted, not
later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, rules
reasonably designed to address conflicts of interest that can arise
when securities analysts recommend equity securities in research
reports and public appearances, in order to improve the objectivity
of research and provide investors with more useful and reliable in-
formation, including rules designed—
(1) to foster greater public confidence in securities re-
search, and to protect the objectivity and independence of secu-
rities analysts, by—
(A) restricting the prepublication clearance or approval
of research reports by persons employed by the broker or
dealer who are engaged in investment banking activities,
or persons not directly responsible for investment research,
other than legal or compliance staff;
(B) limiting the supervision and compensatory evalua-
tion of securities analysts to officials employed by the
broker or dealer who are not engaged in investment bank-
ing activities; and
(C) requiring that a broker or dealer and persons em-
ployed by a broker or dealer who are involved with invest-
ment banking activities may not, directly or indirectly, re-
taliate against or threaten to retaliate against any securi-
ties analyst employed by that broker or dealer or its affili-
ates as a result of an adverse, negative, or otherwise unfa-
vorable research report that may adversely affect the
present or prospective investment banking relationship of
the broker or dealer with the issuer that is the subject of
the research report, except that such rules may not limit
the authority of a broker or dealer to discipline a securities
analyst for causes other than such research report in ac-
cordance with the policies and procedures of the firm;
(2) to define periods during which brokers or dealers who
have participated, or are to participate, in a public offering of
securities as underwriters or dealers should not publish or oth-
erwise distribute research reports relating to such securities or
to the issuer of such securities;
(3) to establish structural and institutional safeguards
within registered brokers or dealers to assure that securities
analysts are separated by appropriate informational partitions
within the firm from the review, pressure, or oversight of those
whose involvement in investment banking activities might po-
tentially bias their judgment or supervision; and

and direction of the Commission, a registered securities association
or national securities exchange, shall have adopted, not later than
1 year after the date of enactment of this section, rules reasonably
designed to require each securities analyst to disclose in public ap-
pearances, and each registered broker or dealer to disclose in each
research report, as applicable, conflicts of interest that are known
or should have been known by the securities analyst or the broker
or dealer, to exist at the time of the appearance or the date of dis-
tribution of the report, including—
(1) the extent to which the securities analyst has debt or
equity investments in the issuer that is the subject of the ap-
pearance or research report;
(2) whether any compensation has been received by the
registered broker or dealer, or any affiliate thereof, including
the securities analyst, from the issuer that is the subject of the
appearance or research report, subject to such exemptions as
the Commission may determine appropriate and necessary to
prevent disclosure by virtue of this paragraph of material non-
public information regarding specific potential future invest-
ment banking transactions of such issuer, as is appropriate in
the public interest and consistent with the protection of inves-
tors;
(3) whether an issuer, the securities of which are rec-
ommended in the appearance or research report, currently is,
or during the 1-year period preceding the date of the appear-
ance or date of distribution of the report has been, a client of
the registered broker or dealer, and if so, stating the types of
services provided to the issuer;
(4) whether the securities analyst received compensation
with respect to a research report, based upon (among any other
factors) the investment banking revenues (either generally or
specifically earned from the issuer being analyzed) of the reg-
istered broker or dealer; and
(5) such other disclosures of conflicts of interest that are
material to investors, research analysts, or the broker or dealer
as the Commission, or such association or exchange, deter-
mines appropriate.
(c) LIMITATION.—Notwithstanding subsection (a) or any other
provision of law, neither the Commission nor any national securi-
ties association registered under section 15A may adopt or main-
tain any rule or regulation in connection with an initial public of-
fering of the common equity of an emerging growth company—
(1) restricting, based on functional role, which associated
persons of a broker, dealer, or member of a national securities
association, may arrange for communications between a securi-
ties analyst and a potential investor; or

any communications with the management of an emerging
growth company that is also attended by any other associated
person of a broker, dealer, or member of a national securities

strumentality of a State or territory that is exempt
from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933 by reason of section 3(a)(2) of that Act (15
U.S.C. 77c(a)(2)), or a security defined as a qualified
scholarship funding bond in section 150(d)(2) of the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986, as may be appropriate
in the public interest and for the protection of inves-
tors; and
(iv) the allocation of risk retention obligations be-
tween a securitizer and an originator in the case of a
securitizer that purchases assets from an originator,
as the Federal banking agencies and the Commission
jointly determine appropriate.
(2) ASSET CLASSES.—
(A) ASSET CLASSES.—The regulations prescribed under
subsection (b) shall establish asset classes with separate
rules for securitizers of different classes of assets, includ-
ing residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, commer-
cial loans, auto loans, and any other class of assets that
the Federal banking agencies and the Commission deem
appropriate.
(B) CONTENTS.—For each asset class established under
subparagraph (A), the regulations prescribed under sub-
section (b) shall include underwriting standards estab-
lished by the Federal banking agencies that specify the
terms, conditions, and characteristics of a loan within the
asset class that indicate a low credit risk with respect to
the loan.
(d) ORIGINATORS.—In determining how to allocate risk reten-
tion obligations between a securitizer and an originator under sub-
section (c)(1)(E)(iv), the Federal banking agencies and the Commis-
sion shall—
(1) reduce the percentage of risk retention obligations re-
quired of the securitizer by the percentage of risk retention ob-
ligations required of the originator; and
(2) consider—
(A) whether the assets sold to the securitizer have
terms, conditions, and characteristics that reflect low cred-
it risk;
(B) whether the form or volume of transactions in
securitization markets creates incentives for imprudent
origination of the type of loan or asset to be sold to the
securitizer; and
(C) the potential impact of the risk retention obliga-
tions on the access of consumers and businesses to credit
on reasonable terms, which may not include the transfer
of credit risk to a third party.
(e) EXEMPTIONS, EXCEPTIONS, AND ADJUSTMENTS.—
(1) I N GENERAL.—The Federal banking agencies and the
Commission may jointly adopt or issue exemptions, exceptions,
or adjustments to the rules issued under this section, including
exemptions, exceptions, or adjustments for classes of institu-

tions or assets relating to the risk retention requirement and
the prohibition on hedging under subsection (c)(1).
(2) APPLICABLE STANDARDS.—Any exemption, exception, or
adjustment adopted or issued by the Federal banking agencies
and the Commission under this paragraph shall—
(A) help ensure high quality underwriting standards
for the securitizers and originators of assets that are
securitized or available for securitization; and
(B) encourage appropriate risk management practices
by the securitizers and originators of assets, improve the
access of consumers and businesses to credit on reasonable
terms, or otherwise be in the public interest and for the
protection of investors.
(3) CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS AND PROGRAMS EXEMPT.—
(A) FARM CREDIT SYSTEM INSTITUTIONS.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of this section, the require-
ments of this section shall not apply to any loan or other
financial asset made, insured, guaranteed, or purchased by
any institution that is subject to the supervision of the
Farm Credit Administration, including the Federal Agri-
cultural Mortgage Corporation.
(B) OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS.—This section shall not
apply to any residential, multifamily, or health care facil-
ity mortgage loan asset, or securitization based directly or
indirectly on such an asset, which is insured or guaranteed
by the United States or an agency of the United States.
For purposes of this subsection, the Federal National
Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, and the Federal home loan banks shall not be
considered an agency of the United States.
(4) EXEMPTION FOR QUALIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Federal banking agencies, the
Commission, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, and the Director of the Federal Housing Finance
Agency shall jointly issue regulations to exempt qualified
residential mortgages from the risk retention requirements
of this subsection.
(B) QUALIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE.—The Federal
banking agencies, the Commission, the Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development, and the Director of the Fed-
eral Housing Finance Agency shall jointly define the term
‘‘qualified residential mortgage’’ for purposes of this sub-
section, taking into consideration underwriting and prod-
uct features that historical loan performance data indicate
result in a lower risk of default, such as—
(i) documentation and verification of the financial
resources relied upon to qualify the mortgagor;
(ii) standards with respect to—
(I) the residual income of the mortgagor after
all monthly obligations;
(II) the ratio of the housing payments of the
mortgagor to the monthly income of the mort-
gagor;

mortgagor;
(iii) mitigating the potential for payment shock on
adjustable rate mortgages through product features

(iv) mortgage guarantee insurance or other types

alties, interest-only payments, and other features that

borrower default.
(C) LIMITATION ON DEFINITION.—The Federal banking
agencies, the Commission, the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, and the Director of the Federal Hous-
ing Finance Agency in defining the term ‘‘qualified resi-
dential mortgage’’, as required by subparagraph (B), shall
define that term to be no broader than the definition
‘‘qualified mortgage’’ as the term is defined under section

Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, and regula-
tions adopted thereunder.
(5) CONDITION FOR QUALIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE EX-

supervisory controls of the issuer with respect to the process
for ensuring that all assets that collateralize the asset-backed
security are qualified residential mortgages.
(f) ENFORCEMENT.—The regulations issued under this section
shall be enforced by—

(a) DISCLOSURES REQUIRED.—
(1) DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AND PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS
REQUIRED TO FILE.—Every person who is directly or indirectly
the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of
any equity security (other than an exempted security) which is
registered pursuant to section 12, or who is a director or an of-
ficer of the issuer of such security, shall file the statements re-
quired by this subsection with the Commission.
(2) TIME OF FILING.—The statements required by this sub-
section shall be filed—
(A) at the time of the registration of such security on
a national securities exchange or by the effective date of
a registration statement filed pursuant to section 12(g);
(B) within 10 days after he or she becomes such bene-
ficial owner, director, or officer, or within such shorter
time as the Commission may establish by rule;
(C) if there has been a change in such ownership, or
if such person shall have purchased or sold a security-
based swap agreement involving such equity security, be-
fore the end of the second business day following the day
on which the subject transaction has been executed, or at
such other time as the Commission shall establish, by rule,
in any case in which the Commission determines that such
2-day period is not feasible.
(3) CONTENTS OF STATEMENTS.—A statement filed—
(A) under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2)
shall contain a statement of the amount of all equity secu-
rities of such issuer of which the filing person is the bene-
ficial owner; and
(B) under subparagraph (C) of such paragraph shall

″Leach″ and ″Bliley″ in the matter proposed to be struck is missing.
(B) the Commission shall provide each such statement

of the business day following that filing; and
(C) the issuer (if the issuer maintains a corporate
website) shall provide that statement on that corporate
website, not later than the end of the business day fol-
lowing that filing.
(b) 35 For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of informa-
tion which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner, direc-
tor, or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer, any profit
realized by him from any purchase and sale, or any sale and pur-
chase, of any equity security of such issuer (other than an exempt-
ed security) or a security-based swap agreement involving any such
equity security within any period of less than six months, unless
such security or security-based swap agreement was acquired in
good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, shall
inure to and be recoverable by the issuer, irrespective of any inten-
tion on the part of such beneficial owner, director, or officer in en-
tering into such transaction of holding the security or security-
based swap agreement purchased or of not repurchasing the secu-
rity or security-based swap agreement sold for a period exceeding
six months. Suit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or
in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer, or
by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and in be-
half of the issuer if the issuer shall fail or refuse to bring such suit
within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute
the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be brought more than
two years after the date such profit was realized. This subsection
shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such bene-
ficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and
sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security or security-based
swap agreement involved, or any transaction or transactions which
the Commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not com-
prehended within the purpose of this subsection.
(c) It shall be unlawful for any such beneficial owner, director,
or officer, directly or indirectly, to sell any equity security of such
issuer (other than an exempted security), if the person selling the
security or his principal (1) does not own the security sold, or (2)
if owning the security, does not deliver it against such sale within
twenty days thereafter, or does not within five days after such sale
deposit it in the mails or other usual channels of transportation;
but no person shall be deemed to have violated this subsection if
he proves that notwithstanding the exercise of good faith he was
unable to make such delivery or deposit within such time, or that
to do so would cause undue inconvenience or expense.
(d) The provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall not
apply to any purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, and the pro-
visions of subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to any sale,

thority to adopt rules with respect to matters as to which, in

subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to this title shall
make such reports to the Board as it may require as necessary or
appropriate to enable it to perform the functions conferred upon it
by this title. If any such broker, dealer, or other person shall fail

(h) RISK ASSESSMENT FOR HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.—
(1) OBLIGATIONS TO OBTAIN, MAINTAIN, AND REPORT INFOR-
MATION.—Every person who is (A) a registered broker or deal-
er, or (B) a registered municipal securities dealer for which the
Commission is the appropriate regulatory agency, shall obtain
such information and make and keep such records as the Com-
mission by rule prescribes concerning the registered person’s
policies, procedures, or systems for monitoring and controlling
financial and operational risks to it resulting from the activi-
ties of any of its associated persons, other than a natural per-
son. Such records shall describe, in the aggregate, each of the
financial and securities activities conducted by, and the cus-
tomary sources of capital and funding of, those of its associated
persons whose business activities are reasonably likely to have
a material impact on the financial or operational condition of
such registered person, including its net capital, its liquidity,
or its ability to conduct or finance its operations. The Commis-
sion, by rule, may require summary reports of such informa-
tion to be filed with the Commission no more frequently than
quarterly.
(2) AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.—If,
as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports
provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
subsection or other available information, the Commission rea-
sonably concludes that it has concerns regarding the financial
or operational condition of (A) any registered broker or dealer,
or (B) any registered municipal securities dealer, government
securities broker, or government securities dealer for which the
Commission is the appropriate regulatory agency, the Commis-
sion may require the registered person to make reports con-
cerning the financial and securities activities of any of such
person’s associated persons, other than a natural person,
whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a mate-
rial impact on the financial or operational condition of such
registered person. The Commission, in requiring reports pursu-
ant to this paragraph, shall specify the information required,
the period for which it is required, the time and date on which

tion is to be furnished directly to the Commission or to a self-
regulatory organization with primary responsibility for exam-
ining the registered person’s financial and operational condi-
tion.(3) SPECIAL PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO ASSOCIATED PER-
SONS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL BANKING AGENCY REGULATION.—
(A) COOPERATION IN IMPLEMENTATION.—In developing
and implementing reporting requirements pursuant to
paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to associated
persons subject to examination by or reporting require-
ments of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall
consult with and consider the views of each such Federal
banking agency. If a Federal banking agency comments in
writing on a proposed rule of the Commission under this
subsection that has been published for comment, the Com-
mission shall respond in writing to such written comment
before adopting the proposed rule. The Commission shall,
at the request of the Federal banking agency, publish such
comment and response in the Federal Register at the time
of publishing the adopted rule.
(B) USE OF BANKING AGENCY REPORTS.—A registered
broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer shall be in
compliance with any recordkeeping or reporting require-
ment adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection
concerning an associated person that is subject to exam-
ination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking
agency if such broker, dealer, or municipal securities deal-
er utilizes for such recordkeeping or reporting requirement
copies of reports filed by the associated person with the
Federal banking agency pursuant to section 5211 of the
Revised Statutes, section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act, sec-
tion 7(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section
10(b) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act, or section 8 of the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Commission may,
however, by rule adopted pursuant to paragraph (1), re-
quire any broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer fil-
ing such reports with the Commission to obtain, maintain,
or report supplemental information if the Commission
makes an explicit finding that such supplemental informa-
tion is necessary to inform the Commission regarding po-
tential risks to such broker, dealer, or municipal securities
dealer. Prior to requiring any such supplemental informa-
tion, the Commission shall first request the Federal bank-
ing agency to expand its reporting requirements to include
such information.
(C) PROCEDURE FOR REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMA-
TION.—Prior to making a request pursuant to paragraph
(2) of this subsection for information with respect to an as-
sociated person that is subject to examination by or report-
ing requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Com-
mission shall—
(i) notify such agency of the information required
with respect to such associated person; and

(ii) consult with such agency to determine whether
the information required is available from such agency
and for other purposes, unless the Commission deter-
mines that any delay resulting from such consultation
would be inconsistent with ensuring the financial and
operational condition of the broker, dealer, municipal
securities dealer, government securities broker, or gov-
ernment securities dealer or the stability or integrity
of the securities markets.
(D) EXCLUSION FOR EXAMINATION REPORTS.—Nothing
in this subsection shall be construed to permit the Com-
mission to require any registered broker or dealer, or any
registered municipal securities dealer, government securi-
ties broker, or government securities dealer for which the
Commission is the appropriate regulatory agency, to ob-
tain, maintain, or furnish any examination report of any
Federal banking agency or any supervisory recommenda-
tions or analysis contained therein.
(E) CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED.—No
information provided to or obtained by the Commission
from any Federal banking agency pursuant to a request by
the Commission under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph
regarding any associated person which is subject to exam-
ination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking
agency may be disclosed to any other person (other than
a self-regulatory organization), without the prior written
approval of the Federal banking agency. Nothing in this
subsection shall authorize the Commission to withhold in-
formation from Congress, or prevent the Commission from
complying with a request for information from any other
Federal department or agency requesting the information
for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or com-
plying with an order of a court of the United States in an
action brought by the United States or the Commission.
(F) NOTICE TO BANKING AGENCIES CONCERNING FINAN-
CIAL AND OPERATIONAL CONDITION CONCERNS.—The Com-
mission shall notify the Federal banking agency of any
concerns of the Commission regarding significant financial
or operational risks resulting from the activities of any
registered broker or dealer, or any registered municipal se-
curities dealer, government securities broker, or govern-
ment securities dealer for which the Commission is the ap-
propriate regulatory agency, to any associated person
thereof which is subject to examination by or reporting re-
quirements of the Federal banking agency.
(G) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this paragraph, the
term ‘‘Federal banking agency’’ shall have the same mean-
ing as the term ‘‘appropriate Federal bank agency’’ in sec-
tion 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.
1813(q)).
(4) EXEMPTIONS.—The Commission by rule or order may
exempt any person or class of persons, under such terms and
conditions and for such periods as the Commission shall pro-
vide in such rule or order, from the provisions of this sub-

tions, the Commission shall consider, among other factors—

lation of the associated person’s activities;

curities activities; and
(E) with respect to the registered person and its asso-
ciated persons, on a consolidated basis, the amount and
proportion of assets devoted to, and revenues derived from,
activities in the United States securities markets.
(5) AUTHORITY TO LIMIT DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.—
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission
shall not be compelled to disclose any information required to
be reported under this subsection, or any information supplied
to the Commission by any domestic or foreign regulatory agen-
cy that relates to the financial or operational condition of any
associated person of a registered broker, dealer, government
securities broker, government securities dealer, or municipal
securities dealer. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize the
Commission to withhold information from Congress, or prevent
the Commission from complying with a request for information
from any other Federal department or agency requesting the
information for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or
complying with an order of a court of the United States in an
action brought by the United States or the Commission. For
purposes of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, this sub-
section shall be considered a statute described in subsection
(b)(3)(B) of such section 552. In prescribing regulations to carry
out the requirements of this subsection, the Commission shall
designate information described in or obtained pursuant to
subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3) of this subsection as
confidential information for purposes of section 24(b)(2) of this
title.

mission by any domestic or foreign regulatory agency that relates
to the financial or operational condition of any associated person of
a broker or dealer, investment bank holding company, or any affil-
iate of an investment bank holding company. Nothing in this sub-
section shall authorize the Commission to withhold information
from Congress, or prevent the Commission from complying with a
request for information from any other Federal department or
agency or any self-regulatory organization requesting the informa-
tion for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or complying

the examining authorities, through cooperation and coordina-
tion of examination and oversight activities, shall eliminate
any unnecessary and burdensome duplication in the examina-

including reports of examinations, customer complaint informa-
tion, and other nonpublic regulatory information, as appro-
priate to foster a coordinated approach to regulatory oversight
of brokers and dealers that are subject to examination by more
than one examining authority.
(3) E XAMINATIONS FOR CAUSE.—At any time, any exam-
ining authority may conduct an examination for cause of any
broker or dealer subject to its jurisdiction.
(4) CONFIDENTIALITY.—
(A) I N GENERAL.—Section 24 shall apply to the sharing
of information in accordance with this subsection. The
Commission shall take appropriate action under section
24(c) to ensure that such information is not inappropri-
ately disclosed.
(B) APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE NOT PROHIBITED.—Noth-
ing in this paragraph authorizes the Commission or any
examining authority to withhold information from the
Congress, or prevent the Commission or any examining
authority from complying with a request for information
from any other Federal department or agency requesting
the information for purposes within the scope of its juris-
diction, or complying with an order of a court of the United
States in an action brought by the United States or the
Commission.
(5) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this subsection, the term
‘‘examining authority’’ means a self-regulatory organization
registered with the Commission under this title (other than a
registered clearing agency) with the authority to examine, in-
spect, and otherwise oversee the activities of a registered

thereto, are necessary for the protection of investors and per-
sons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of inves-
tors.
(B) Inefficient procedures for clearance and settlement im-
pose unnecessary costs on investors and persons facilitating
transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.
(C) New data processing and communications techniques
create the opportunity for more efficient, effective, and safe
procedures for clearance and settlement.
(D) The linking of all clearance and settlement facilities
and the development of uniform standards and procedures for
clearance and settlement will reduce unnecessary costs and in-
crease the protection of investors and persons facilitating
transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.
(2)(A) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due re-
gard for the public interest, the protection of investors, the safe-
guarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competi-
tion among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer
agents, to use its authority under this title—
(i) to facilitate the establishment of a national system for
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of trans-
actions in securities (other than exempt securities); and
(ii) to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated
facilities for clearance and settlement of transactions in securi-
ties, securities options, contracts of sale for future delivery and
options thereon, and commodity options;
in accordance with the findings and to carry out the objectives set
forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(B) The Commission shall use its authority under this title to
assure equal regulation under this title of registered clearing agen-
cies and registered transfer agents. In carrying out its responsibil-
ities set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph, the Com-
mission shall coordinate with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and consult with the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System.
(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be
unlawful for any clearing agency, unless registered in accordance
with this subsection, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails
or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform
the functions of a clearing agency with respect to any security
(other than an exempted security). The Commission, by rule or
order, upon its own motion or upon application, may conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any clearing agency or security or any
class of clearing agencies or securities from any provisions of this
section or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commission
finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the
protection of investors, and the purposes of this section, including
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds. A clear-
ing agency or transfer agent shall not perform the functions of both
a clearing agency and a transfer agent unless such clearing agency
or transfer agent is registered in accordance with this subsection
and subsection (c) of this section.

mission, by rule, may from time to time designate as appro-
priate to the development of a national system or the prompt
and accurate clearance and settlement of securities trans-
actions may become a participant in such clearing agency.
(C) The rules of the clearing agency assure a fair represen-
tation of its shareholders (or members) and participants in the
selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. (The
Commission may determine that the representation of partici-
pants is fair if they are afforded a reasonable opportunity to
acquire voting stock of the clearing agency, directly or indi-
rectly, in reasonable proportion to their use of such clearing
agency.)
(D) The rules of the clearing agency provide for the equi-
table allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges
among its participants.
(E) The rules of the clearing agency do not impose any
schedule of prices, or fix rates or other fees, for services ren-
dered by its participants.
(F) The rules of the clearing agency are designed to pro-
mote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of se-
curities transactions and, to the extent applicable, derivative
agreements, contracts, and transactions, to assure the safe-
guarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or

priately disciplined for violation of any provision of the rules
of the clearing agency by expulsion, suspension, limitation of
activities, functions, and operations, fine, censure, or any other
fitting sanction.
(H) The rules of the clearing agency are in accordance with
the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subsection, and, in gen-
eral, provide a fair procedure with respect to the disciplining
of participants, the denial of participation to any persons seek-
ing participation therein, and the prohibition or limitation by

den on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance

the Commission, by order, directs as appropriate in the public in-
terest shall, deny participation to any person subject to a statutory
disqualification. A registered clearing agency shall file notice with
the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting any
person to participation, if the clearing agency knew, or in the exer-
cise of reasonable care should have known, that such person was
subject to a statutory disqualification. The notice shall be in such
form and contain such information as the Commission, by rule,
may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors.
(B) A registered clearing agency may deny participation to, or
condition the participation of, any person if such person does not
meet such standards of financial responsibility, operational capa-
bility, experience, and competence as are prescribed by the rules of
the clearing agency. A registered clearing agency may examine and
verify the qualifications of an applicant to be a participant in ac-
cordance with procedures established by the rules of the clearing
agency.
(5)(A) In any proceeding by a registered clearing agency to de-
termine whether a participant should be disciplined (other than a
summary proceeding pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this para-
graph), the clearing agency shall bring specific charges, notify such
participant of, and give him an opportunity to defend against such
charges, and keep a record. A determination by the clearing agency
to impose a disciplinary sanction shall be supported by a statement

found to have engaged, or which such participant has been
found to have omitted;
(ii) the specific provisions of the rules of the clearing agen-
cy which any such act or practice, or omission to act, is deemed
to violate; and
(iii) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor.
(B) In any proceeding by a registered clearing agency to deter-
mine whether a person shall be denied participation or prohibited
or limited with respect to access to services offered by the clearing
agency, the clearing agency shall notify such person of, and give
him an opportunity to be heard upon, the specific grounds for de-
nial or prohibition or limitation under consideration and keep a
record. A determination by the clearing agency to deny participa-
tion or prohibit or limit a person with respect to access to services
offered by the clearing agency shall be supported by a statement
setting forth the specific grounds on which the denial or prohibition
or limitation is based.
(C) A registered clearing agency may summarily suspend and
close the accounts of a participant who (i) has been and is expelled
or suspended from any self-regulatory organization, (ii) is in default
of any delivery of funds or securities to the clearing agency, or (iii)
is in such financial or operating difficulty that the clearing agency
determines and so notifies the appropriate regulatory agency for
such participant that such suspension and closing of accounts are
necessary for the protection of the clearing agency, its participants,
creditors, or investors. A participant so summarily suspended shall
be promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the clearing
agency in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of
this paragraph. The appropriate regulatory agency for such partici-
pant, by order, may stay any such summary suspension on its own
motion or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby, if
such appropriate regulatory agency determines summarily or after
notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist sole-
ly of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments)
that such stay is consistent with the public interest and protection
of investors.
(6) No registered clearing agency shall prohibit or limit access
by any person to services offered by any participant therein.
(7)(A) A clearing agency that is regulated directly or indirectly
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through its asso-
ciation with a designated contract market for security futures prod-
ucts that is a national securities exchange registered pursuant to
section 6(g), and that would be required to register pursuant to
paragraph (1) of this subsection only because it performs the func-
tions of a clearing agency with respect to security futures products
effected pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market
with which such agency is associated, is exempted from the provi-
sions of this section and the rules and regulations thereunder, ex-
cept that if such a clearing agency performs the functions of a
clearing agency with respect to a security futures product that is
not cash settled, it must have arrangements in place with a reg-
istered clearing agency to effect the payment and delivery of the se-
curities underlying the security futures product.

(B) Any clearing agency that performs the functions of a clear-
ing agency with respect to security futures products must coordi-
nate with and develop fair and reasonable links with any and all
other clearing agencies that perform the functions of a clearing
agency with respect to security futures products, in order to permit,
as of the compliance date (as defined in section 6(h)(6)(C)), security
futures products to be purchased on one market and offset on an-
other market that trades such products.
(8) A registered clearing agency shall be permitted to provide
facilities for the clearance and settlement of any derivative agree-
ments, contracts, or transactions that are excluded from the Com-
modity Exchange Act, subject to the requirements of this section
and to such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe
as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this
title.(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be
unlawful for any transfer agent, unless registered in accordance
with this section, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails
or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform
the function of a transfer agent with respect to any security reg-
istered under section 12 of this title or which would be required to
be registered except for the exemption from registration provided
by subsection (g)(2)(B) or (g)(2)(G) of that section. The appropriate
regulatory agency, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon
application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any per-
son or security or class of persons or securities from any provision
of this section or any rule or regulation prescribed under this sec-
tion, if the appropriate regulatory agency finds (A) that such ex-
emption is in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes of this section, including the prompt
and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions
and the safeguarding of securities and funds, and (B) the Commis-
sion does not object to such exemption.
(2) A transfer agent may be registered by filing with the appro-
priate regulatory agency for such transfer agent an application for
registration in such form and containing such information and doc-
uments concerning such transfer agent and any persons associated
with the transfer agent as such appropriate regulatory agency may
prescribe as necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the pur-
poses of this section. Except as hereinafter provided, such registra-
tion shall become effective 45 days after receipt of such application
by such appropriate regulatory agency or within such shorter pe-
riod of time as such appropriate regulatory agency may determine.

order, shall deny registration to, censure, place limitations on the
activities, functions, or operations of, suspend for a period not ex-
ceeding 12 months, or revoke the registration of such transfer
agent, if such appropriate regulatory agency finds, on the record
after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such denial, censure,

(4)(A) Pending final determination whether any registration by
a transfer agent under this subsection shall be denied, the appro-
priate regulatory agency for such transfer agent, by order, may
postpone the effective date of such registration for a period not to
exceed fifteen days, but if, after notice and opportunity for hearing
(which may consist solely of affidavits and oral arguments), it shall
appear to such appropriate regulatory agency to be necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors
to postpone the effective date of such registration until final deter-
mination, such appropriate regulatory agency shall so order. Pend-
ing final determination whether any registration under this sub-
section shall be revoked, such appropriate regulatory agency, by
order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears
to such appropriate regulatory agency, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors.
(B) A registered transfer agent may, upon such terms and con-
ditions as the appropriate regulatory agency for such transfer
agent deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or in furtherance of the purposes of this sec-
tion, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of with-
drawal with such appropriate regulatory agency. If such appro-
priate regulatory agency finds that any transfer agent for which it
is the appropriate regulatory agency, is no longer in existence or
has ceased to do business as a transfer agent, such appropriate reg-
ulatory agency, by order, shall cancel or deny the registration.
(C) The appropriate regulatory agency for a transfer agent, by
order, shall censure or place limitations on the activities or func-
tions of any person associated, seeking to become associated, or, at
the time of the alleged misconduct, associated or seeking to become
associated with the transfer agent, or suspend for a period not ex-
ceeding 12 months or bar any such person from being associated
with any transfer agent, broker, dealer, investment adviser, munic-

statistical rating organization, if the appropriate regulatory agency
finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that
such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or bar is in the

ment of the proceedings under this paragraph, or is enjoined from
any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph (C) of
such paragraph (4). It shall be unlawful for any person as to whom
such an order suspending or barring him from being associated
with a transfer agent is in effect willfully to become, or to be, asso-
ciated with a transfer agent without the consent of the appropriate
regulatory agency that entered the order and the appropriate regu-
latory agency for that transfer agent. It shall be unlawful for any
transfer agent to permit such a person to become, or remain, a per-
son associated with it without the consent of such appropriate reg-
ulatory agencies, if the transfer agent knew, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should have known, of such order. The Commission
may establish, by rule, procedures by which a transfer agent rea-
sonably can determine whether a person associated or seeking to
become associated with it is subject to any such order, and may re-
quire, by rule, that any transfer agent comply with such proce-
dures.
(d)(1) No registered clearing agency or registered transfer
agent shall, directly or indirectly, engage in any activity as clearing
agency or transfer agent in contravention of such rules and regula-
tions (A) as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or oth-
erwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title, or (B) as the ap-
propriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency or transfer
agent may prescribe as necessary or appropriate for the safe-
guarding of securities and funds.
(2) With respect to any clearing agency or transfer agent for
which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency,
the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency or
transfer agent may, in accordance with section 8 of the Federal De-
posit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818), enforce compliance by such
clearing agency or transfer agent with the provisions of this sec-
tion, sections 17 and 19 of this title, and the rules and regulations
thereunder. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any violation
of any such provision shall constitute adequate basis for the
issuance of an order under section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal De-
posit Insurance Act, and the participants in any such clearing
agency and the persons doing business with any such transfer
agent shall be deemed to be ‘‘depositors’’ as that term is used in
section 8(c) of that Act.
(3)(A) With respect to any clearing agency or transfer agent for
which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency,
the Commission and the appropriate regulatory agency for such
clearing agency or transfer agent shall consult and cooperate with
each other, and, as may be appropriate, with State banking au-
thorities having supervision over such clearing agency or transfer
agent toward the end that, to the maximum extent practicable,
their respective regulatory responsibilities may be fulfilled and the
rules and regulations applicable to such clearing agency or transfer
agent may be in accord with both sound banking practices and a
national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settle-
ment of securities transactions. In accordance with this objective—

(ii) such appropriate regulatory agency shall assume pri-
mary responsibility to examine and enforce compliance by such
clearing agency or transfer agent with the provisions of this
section and sections 17 and 19 of this title.
(B) Nothing in the preceding subparagraph or elsewhere in this
title shall be construed to impair or limit (other than by the re-
quirement of notification) the Commission’s authority to make
rules under any provision of this title or to enforce compliance pur-
suant to any provision of this title by any clearing agency, transfer
agent, or person associated with a transfer agent with the provi-
sions of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the au-
thority of any State banking authority or other State or Federal
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over a person registered as
a clearing agency, transfer agent, or person associated with a
transfer agent, to make and enforce rules governing such person
which are not inconsistent with this title and the rules and regula-
tions thereunder.
(5) A registered transfer agent may not, directly or indirectly,
engage in any activity in connection with the guarantee of a signa-
ture of an endorser of a security, including the acceptance or rejec-
tion of such guarantee, in contravention of such rules and regula-
tions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, to facilitate
the equitable treatment of financial institutions which issue such
guarantees, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this
title.(e) The Commission shall use its authority under this title to
end the physical movement of securities certificates in connection
with the settlement among brokers and dealers of transactions in
securities consummated by means of the mails or any means or in-
strumentalities of interstate commerce.
(f)(1) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, except as
provided in paragraph (3), if the Commission makes each of the
findings described in paragraph (2)(A), the Commission may adopt
rules concerning—
(A) the transfer of certificated or uncertificated securities
(other than government securities issued pursuant to chapter
31 of title 31, United States Code, or securities otherwise proc-
essed within a book-entry system operated by the Federal Re-
serve banks pursuant to a Federal book-entry regulation) or
limited interests (including security interests) therein; and
(B) rights and obligations of purchasers, sellers, owners,
lenders, borrowers, and financial intermediaries (including bro-
kers, dealers, banks, and clearing agencies) involved in or af-
fected by such transfers, and the rights of third parties whose
interests in such securities devolve from such transfers.

to promote the prompt, accurate, and safe clearance and settle-
ment of securities transactions;
(ii) in the absence of a uniform rule, the safe and efficient
operation of the national system for clearance and settlement
of securities transactions will be, or is, substantially impeded;
and (iii) to the extent such rule will impair or diminish, di-
rectly or indirectly, rights of persons specified in paragraph

limited interests therein), the benefits of such rule outweigh
such impairment or diminution of rights.
(B) In making the findings described in subparagraph (A), the
Commission shall give consideration to the recommendations of the
Advisory Committee established under paragraph (4), and it shall
consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If
the Secretary of the Treasury objects, in writing, to any proposed
rule of the Commission on the basis of the Secretary’s view on the
issues described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A), the
Commission shall consider all feasible alternatives to the proposed
rule, and it shall not adopt any such rule unless the Commission
makes an explicit finding that the rule is the most practicable
method for achieving safe and efficient operation of the national
clearance and settlement system.
(3) Any State may, prior to the expiration of 2 years after the
Commission adopts a rule under this subsection, enact a statute
that specifically refers to this subsection and the specific rule
thereunder and establishes, prospectively from the date of enact-
ment of the State statute, a provision that differs from that appli-
cable under the Commission’s rule.
(4)(A) Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this sub-
section, the Commission shall (and at such times thereafter as the
Commission may determine, the Commission may), after consulta-
tion with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, establish an advisory committee
under chapter 10 of title 5, United States Code. The Advisory Com-
mittee shall be directed to consider and report to the Commission
on such matters as the Commission, after consultation with the
Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System, determines, including the areas, if any, in
which State commercial laws and related Federal laws concerning
the transfer of certificated or uncertificated securities, limited in-
terests (including security interests) in such securities, or the cre-
ation or perfection of security interests in such securities do not
provide the necessary certainty, uniformity, and clarity for pur-
chasers, sellers, owners, lenders, borrowers, and financial inter-
mediaries concerning their respective rights and obligations.
(B) The Advisory Committee shall consist of 15 members, of
which— (i) 11 shall be designated by the Commission in accordance
with chapter 10 of title 5, United States Code; and
(ii) 2 each shall be designated by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the Treas-
ury.

(g) DUE DILIGENCE FOR THE DELIVERY OF DIVIDENDS, INTER-
EST, AND OTHER VALUABLE PROPERTY RIGHTS.—
(1) REVISION OF RULES REQUIRED.—The Commission shall
revise its regulations in section 240.17Ad–17 of title 17, Code
of Federal Regulations, as in effect on December 8, 1997, to ex-
tend the application of such section to brokers and dealers and
to provide for the following:
(A) A requirement that the paying agent provide a sin-
gle written notification to each missing security holder
that the missing security holder has been sent a check
that has not yet been negotiated. The written notification
may be sent along with a check or other mailing subse-
quently sent to the missing security holder but must be
provided no later than 7 months after the sending of the
not yet negotiated check.
(B) An exclusion for paying agents from the notifica-
tion requirements when the value of the not yet negotiated
check is less than $25.
(C) A provision clarifying that the requirements de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) shall have no effect on State
escheatment laws.
(D) For purposes of such revised regulations—
(i) a security holder shall be considered a ‘‘missing
security holder’’ if a check is sent to the security hold-
er and the check is not negotiated before the earlier of
the paying agent sending the next regularly scheduled
check or the elapsing of 6 months after the sending of
the not yet negotiated check; and
(ii) the term ‘‘paying agent’’ includes any issuer,
transfer agent, broker, dealer, investment adviser, in-
denture trustee, custodian, or any other person that
accepts payments from the issuer of a security and
distributes the payments to the holders of the security.
(2) RULEMAKING.—The Commission shall adopt such rules,
regulations, and orders necessary to implement this subsection
no later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this sub-
section. In proposing such rules, the Commission shall seek to
minimize disruptions to current systems used by or on behalf
of paying agents to process payment to account holders and
avoid requiring multiple paying agents to send written notifi-
cation to a missing security holder regarding the same not yet
negotiated check.

indirectly to make use of the mails or any means or instrumen-

agency with respect to a security-based swap.
(h) VOLUNTARY REGISTRATION.—A person that clears agree-
ments, contracts, or transactions that are not required to be cleared
under this title may register with the Commission as a clearing
agency.
(i) STANDARDS FOR CLEARING AGENCIES CLEARING SECURITY-
BASED SWAP TRANSACTIONS.—To be registered and to maintain reg-
istration as a clearing agency that clears security-based swap
transactions, a clearing agency shall comply with such standards
as the Commission may establish by rule. In establishing any such
standards, and in the exercise of its oversight of such a clearing
agency pursuant to this title, the Commission may conform such
standards or oversight to reflect evolving United States and inter-
national standards. Except where the Commission determines oth-
erwise by rule or regulation, a clearing agency shall have reason-
able discretion in establishing the manner in which it complies
with any such standards.
(j) RULES.—The Commission shall adopt rules governing per-
sons that are registered as clearing agencies for security-based
swaps under this title.
(k) EXEMPTIONS.—The Commission may exempt, conditionally
or unconditionally, a clearing agency from registration under this
section for the clearing of security-based swaps if the Commission
determines that the clearing agency is subject to comparable, com-
prehensive supervision and regulation by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission or the appropriate government authorities in
the home country of the agency. Such conditions may include, but
are not limited to, requiring that the clearing agency be available
for inspection by the Commission and make available all informa-
tion requested by the Commission.
(l) EXISTING DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND DERIVATIVE CLEAR-
ING ORGANIZATIONS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—A depository institution or derivative
clearing organization registered with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act that
is required to be registered as a clearing agency under this sec-
tion is deemed to be registered under this section solely for the
purpose of clearing security-based swaps to the extent that, be-
fore the date of enactment of this subsection—
(A) the depository institution cleared swaps as a mul-
tilateral clearing organization; or
(B) the derivative clearing organization cleared swaps
pursuant to an exemption from registration as a clearing
agency.
(2) CONVERSION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.—A deposi-
tory institution to which this subsection applies may, by the
vote of the shareholders owning not less than 51 percent of the
voting interests of the depository institution, be converted into
a State corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or
similar legal form pursuant to a plan of conversion, if the con-
version is not in contravention of applicable State law.
(3) SHARING OF INFORMATION.—The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission shall make available to the Commission,

tives clearing organization deemed to be registered with the

may conform the core principles established in this section to re-
flect evolving United States and international standards.
AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEMS FOR PENNY STOCKS
S EC. 17B. ø78q–2¿ (a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that—
(1) the market for penny stocks suffers from a lack of reli-
able and accurate quotation and last sale information available
to investors and regulators;
(2) it is in the public interest and appropriate for the pro-
tection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets to improve significantly the information available to
brokers, dealers, investors, and regulators with respect to
quotations for and transactions in penny stocks; and
(3) a fully implemented automated quotation system for
penny stocks would meet the information needs of investors
and market participants and would add visibility and regu-
latory and surveillance data to that market.
(b) MANDATE TO FACILITATE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AUTO-
MATED QUOTATION SYSTEMS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall facilitate the
widespread dissemination of reliable and accurate last sale and
quotation information with respect to penny stocks in accord-
ance with the findings set forth in subsection (a), with a view
toward establishing, at the earliest feasible time, one or more
automated quotation systems that will collect and disseminate
information regarding all penny stocks.
(2) CHARACTERISTICS OF SYSTEMS.—Each such automated
quotation system shall—

made any statement in any application, report, or document filed
pursuant to this title or any rule or regulation thereunder or any
undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided in
subsection (d) of section 15 of this title, which statement was at the
time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was
made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall
be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false
or misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement shall have
purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge

cretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’

should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the
grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for
hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred eighty days
of the date of a publication of notice of the filing of the applica-

extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such
longer period as to which the applicant consents.
The Commission shall grant such registration if it finds that the
requirements of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder
with respect to the applicant are satisfied. The Commission shall
deny such registration if it does not make such finding.
(2) With respect to an application for registration filed by a
clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate
regulatory agency—
(A) The Commission shall not grant registration prior to
the sixtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the fil-
ing of such application unless the appropriate regulatory agen-
cy for such clearing agency has notified the Commission of
such appropriate regulatory agency’s determination that such
clearing agency is so organized and has the capacity to be able
to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or
for which it is responsible and that the rules of such clearing
agency are designed to assure the safeguarding of such securi-
ties and funds.
(B) The Commission shall institute proceedings in accord-
ance with paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection to determine
whether registration should be denied if the appropriate regu-
latory agency for such clearing agency notifies the Commission
within sixty days of the date of publication of notice of the fil-
ing of such application of such appropriate regulatory agency’s
(i) determination that such clearing agency may not be so orga-
nized or have the capacity to be able to safeguard securities or
funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible or
that the rules of such clearing agency may not be designed to
assure the safeguarding of such securities and funds and (ii)
reasons for such determination.
(C) The Commission shall deny registration if the appro-
priate regulatory agency for such clearing agency notifies the
Commission prior to the conclusion of proceedings instituted in
accordance with paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection of such ap-
propriate regulatory agency’s (i) determination that such clear-
ing agency is not so organized or does not have the capacity
to be able to safeguard securities or funds in its custody or con-
trol or for which it is responsible or that the rules of such
clearing agency are not designed to assure the safeguarding of
such securities or funds and (ii) reasons for such determina-
tion.

(3) A self-regulatory organization may, upon such terms and
conditions as the Commission, by rule, deems necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, with-
draw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with
the Commission. If the Commission finds that any self-regulatory
organization is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business
in the capacity specified in its application for registration, the Com-
mission, by order, shall cancel its registration. Upon the with-
drawal of a national securities association from registration or the
cancellation, suspension, or revocation of the registration of a na-
tional securities association, the registration of any association af-
filiated therewith shall automatically terminate.
(b)(1) Each self-regulatory organization shall file with the Com-
mission, in accordance with such rules as the Commission may pre-
scribe, copies of any proposed rule or any proposed change in, addi-
tion to, or deletion from the rules of such self-regulatory organiza-
tion (hereinafter in this subsection collectively referred to as a ‘‘pro-
posed rule change’’) accompanied by a concise general statement of
the basis and purpose of such proposed rule change. The Commis-
sion shall, as soon as practicable after the date of the filing of any
proposed rule change, publish notice thereof together with the

the subjects and issues involved. The Commission shall give inter-
ested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and ar-
guments concerning such proposed rule change. No proposed rule
change shall take effect unless approved by the Commission or oth-
erwise permitted in accordance with the provisions of this sub-
section. (2) APPROVAL PROCESS.—

(F) RULEMAKING.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the
date of enactment of the Investor Protection and Secu-
rities Reform Act of 2010, after consultation with
other regulatory agencies, the Commission shall pro-
mulgate rules setting forth the procedural require-
ments of the proceedings required under this para-
graph.
(ii) NOTICE AND COMMENT NOT REQUIRED.—The
rules promulgated by the Commission under clause (i)
are not required to include republication of proposed
rule changes or solicitation of public comment.
(3)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this
subsection, a proposed rule change shall take effect upon filing
with the Commission if designated by the self-regulatory organiza-
tion as (i) constituting a stated policy, practice, or interpretation
with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an
existing rule of the self-regulatory organization, (ii) establishing or
changing a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory
organization on any person, whether or not the person is a member
of the self-regulatory organization, or (iii) concerned solely with the
administration of the self-regulatory organization or other matters
which the Commission, by rule, consistent with the public interest
and the purposes of this subsection, may specify as without the
provisions of such paragraph (2).
(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a
proposed rule change may be put into effect summarily if it ap-
pears to the Commission that such action is necessary for the pro-
tection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets,
or the safeguarding of securities or funds. Any proposed rule
change so put into effect shall be filed promptly thereafter in ac-
cordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(C) Any proposed rule change of a self-regulatory organization
which has taken effect pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of this
paragraph may be enforced by such organization to the extent it is
not inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the rules and reg-
ulations thereunder, and applicable Federal and State law. At any
time within the 60-day period beginning on the date of filing of
such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph (1), the Commission summarily may temporarily sus-
pend the change in the rules of the self-regulatory organization
made thereby, if it appears to the Commission that such action is
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this
title. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall in-
stitute proceedings under paragraph (2)(B) to determine whether

the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved. Commission
action pursuant to this subparagraph shall not affect the validity
or force of the rule change during the period it was in effect and
shall not be reviewable under section 25 of this title, nor deemed
to be ‘‘final agency action’’ for purposes of section 704 of title 5,
United States Code.
(4) With respect to a proposed rule changed filed by a reg-
istered clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appro-
priate regulatory agency—
(A) The Commission shall not approve any such proposed
rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publica-
tion of notice of the filing thereof unless the appropriate regu-
latory agency for such clearing agency has notified the Com-
mission of such appropriate regulatory agency’s determination
that the proposed rule change is consistent with the safe-
guarding of securities and funds in the custody or control of
such clearing agency or for which it is responsible.
(B) The Commission shall institute proceedings in accord-
ance with paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection to determine
whether any such proposed rule change should be disapproved,
if the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency
notifies the Commission within thirty days of the date of publi-
cation of notice of the filing of the proposed rule change of such
appropriate regulatory agency’s (i) determination that the pro-
posed rule change may be inconsistent with the safeguarding
of securities or funds in the custody or control of such clearing
agency or for which it is responsible and (ii) reasons for such
determination.
(C) The Commission shall disapprove any such proposed
rule change if the appropriate regulatory agency for such clear-
ing agency notifies the Commission prior to the conclusion of
proceedings instituted in accordance with paragraph (2)(B) of
this subsection of such appropriate regulatory agency’s (i) de-
termination that the proposed rule change is inconsistent with
the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control
of such clearing agency or for which it is responsible and (ii)
reasons for such determination.
(D) 40 (i) The Commission shall order the temporary
suspension of any change in the rules of a clearing agency
made by a proposed rule change that has taken effect
under paragraph (3), if the appropriate regulatory agency
for the clearing agency notifies the Commission not later
than 30 days after the date on which the proposed rule
change was filed of—
(I) the determination by the appropriate regu-
latory agency that the rules of such clearing agency,
as so changed, may be inconsistent with the safe-
guarding of securities or funds in the custody or con-
trol of such clearing agency or for which it is respon-
sible; and
(II) the reasons for the determination described in
subclause (I).

(ii) If the Commission takes action under clause (i),
the Commission shall institute proceedings under para-
graph (2)(B) to determine if the proposed rule change
should be approved or disapproved.
(5) The Commission shall consult with and consider the views
of the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule
filed by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requir-
ing expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons there-
for. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the
Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for com-
ment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written
comment before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule,
if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or
(ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission
shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is
necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.
(6) In approving rules described in paragraph (5), the Commis-
sion shall consider the sufficiency and appropriateness of then ex-
isting laws and rules applicable to government securities brokers,
government securities dealers, and persons associated with govern-
ment securities brokers and government securities dealers.
(7) 41 SECURITY FUTURES PRODUCT RULE CHANGES.—
(A) FILING REQUIRED.—A self-regulatory organization
that is an exchange registered with the Commission pursu-
ant to section 6(g) of this title or that is a national securi-
ties association registered pursuant to section 15A(k) of
this title shall file with the Commission, in accordance
with such rules as the Commission may prescribe, copies
of any proposed rule change or any proposed change in, ad-
dition to, or deletion from the rules of such self-regulatory
organization (hereinafter in this paragraph collectively re-
ferred to as a ‘‘proposed rule change’’) that relates to high-
er margin levels, fraud or manipulation, recordkeeping, re-
porting, listing standards, or decimal pricing for security
futures products, sales practices for security futures prod-
ucts for persons who effect transactions in security futures
products, or rules effectuating such self-regulatory organi-
zation’s obligation to enforce the securities laws. Such pro-
posed rule change shall be accompanied by a concise gen-
eral statement of the basis and purpose of such proposed
rule change. The Commission shall, upon the filing of any
proposed rule change, promptly publish notice thereof to-
gether with the terms of substance of the proposed rule
change or a description of the subjects and issues involved.
The Commission shall give interested persons an oppor-

tunity to submit data, views, and arguments concerning
such proposed rule change.
(B) FILING WITH CFTC.—A proposed rule change filed
with the Commission pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall
be filed concurrently with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. Such proposed rule change may take effect
upon filing of a written certification with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission under section 5c(c) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, upon a determination by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission that review of
the proposed rule change is not necessary, or upon ap-
proval of the proposed rule change by the Commodity Fu-
tures Trading Commission.
(C) ABROGATION OF RULE CHANGES.—Any proposed
rule change of a self-regulatory organization that has
taken effect pursuant to subparagraph (B) may be enforced
by such self-regulatory organization to the extent such rule
is not inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the
rules and regulations thereunder, and applicable Federal
law. At any time within 60 days of the date of the filing
of a written certification with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission under section 5c(c) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, the date the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission determines that review of such proposed rule
change is not necessary, or the date the Commodity Fu-
tures Trading Commission approves such proposed rule
change, the Commission, after consultation with the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission, may summarily ab-
rogate the proposed rule change and require that the pro-
posed rule change be refiled in accordance with the provi-
sions of paragraph (1), if it appears to the Commission
that such proposed rule change unduly burdens competi-
tion or efficiency, conflicts with the securities laws, or is
inconsistent with the public interest and the protection of
investors. Commission action pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall not affect the validity or force of the rule
change during the period it was in effect and shall not be
reviewable under section 25 of this title nor deemed to be
a final agency action for purposes of section 704 of title 5,
United States Code.
(D) REVIEW OF RESUBMITTED ABROGATED RULES.—
(i) PROCEEDINGS.—Within 35 days of the date of
publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule
change that is abrogated in accordance with subpara-
graph (C) and refiled in accordance with paragraph
(1), or within such longer period as the Commission
may designate up to 90 days after such date if the
Commission finds such longer period to be appropriate
and publishes its reasons for so finding or as to which
the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commis-
sion shall—
(I) by order approve such proposed rule
change; or

Futures Trading Commission, institute pro-
ceedings to determine whether the proposed rule
change should be disapproved. Proceedings under
subclause (II) shall include notice of the grounds
for disapproval under consideration and oppor-
tunity for hearing and be concluded within 180
days after the date of publication of notice of the
filing of the proposed rule change. At the conclu-
sion of such proceedings, the Commission, by
order, shall approve or disapprove such proposed
rule change. The Commission may extend the
time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to
60 days if the Commission finds good cause for
such extension and publishes its reasons for so
finding or for such longer period as to which the
self-regulatory organization consents.
(ii) GROUNDS FOR APPROVAL.—The Commission
shall approve a proposed rule change of a self-regu-
latory organization under this subparagraph if the
Commission finds that such proposed rule change does
not unduly burden competition or efficiency, does not
conflict with the securities laws, and is not incon-
sistent with the public interest or the protection of in-
vestors. The Commission shall disapprove such a pro-
posed rule change of a self-regulatory organization if
it does not make such finding. The Commission shall
not approve any proposed rule change prior to the
30th day after the date of publication of notice of the
filing thereof, unless the Commission finds good cause
for so doing and publishes its reasons for so finding.
(8) DECIMAL PRICING.—Not later than 9 months after the
date on which trading in any security futures product com-
mences under this title, all self-regulatory organizations listing
or trading security futures products shall file proposed rule
changes necessary to implement decimal pricing of security fu-
tures products. The Commission may not require such rules to
contain equal minimum increments in such decimal pricing.
(9) CONSULTATION WITH CFTC.—
(A) CONSULTATION REQUIRED.—The Commission shall
consult with and consider the views of the Commodity Fu-
tures Trading Commission prior to approving or dis-
approving a proposed rule change filed by a national secu-
rities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) or
a national securities exchange subject to the provisions of
subsection (a) that primarily concerns conduct related to
transactions in security futures products, except where the
Commission determines that an emergency exists requir-
ing expeditious or summary action and publishes its rea-
sons therefor.
(B) RESPONSES TO CFTC COMMENTS AND FINDINGS.—If

been published for comment, the Commission shall re-

date of filing of a proposed rule change shall be deemed to
be the date on which the Commission receives the pro-
posed rule change.
(B) EXCEPTION.—A proposed rule change has not been
received by the Commission for purposes of subparagraph
(A) if, not later than 7 business days after the date of re-
ceipt by the Commission, the Commission notifies the self-
regulatory organization that such proposed rule change
does not comply with the rules of the Commission relating
to the required form of a proposed rule change, except that
if the Commission determines that the proposed rule
change is unusually lengthy and is complex or raises novel
regulatory issues, the Commission shall inform the self-
regulatory organization of such determination not later
than 7 business days after the date of receipt by the Com-
mission and, for the purposes of subparagraph (A), a pro-
posed rule change has not been received by the Commis-
sion, if, not later than 21 days after the date of receipt by

a proposed rule change or institute proceedings to determine
whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved is

whether a product that is the subject of such proposed rule
change is a security pursuant to section 718 of the Wall Street
Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010.

‘‘amend’’) the rules of a self-regulatory organization (other than a
registered clearing agency) as the Commission deems necessary or
appropriate to insure the fair administration of the self-regulatory
organization, to conform its rules to requirements of this title and
the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such organiza-
tion, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title, in the
following manner:
(1) The Commission shall notify the self-regulatory organi-
zation and publish notice of the proposed rulemaking in the
Federal Register. The notice shall include the text of the pro-
posed amendment to the rules of the self-regulatory organiza-
tion and a statement of the Commission’s reasons, including
any pertinent facts, for commencing such proposed rulemaking.
(2) The Commission shall give interested persons an oppor-
tunity for the oral presentation of data, views, and arguments,
in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A
transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation.
(3) A rule adopted pursuant to this subsection shall incor-
porate the text of the amendment to the rules of the self-regu-
latory organization and a statement of the Commission’s basis
for and purpose in so amending such rules. This statement
shall include an identification of any facts on which the Com-
mission considers its determination so to amend the rules of
the self-regulatory agency to be based, including the reasons
for the Commission’s conclusions as to any of such facts which
were disputed in the rulemaking.
(4)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (1) through (3) of
this subsection, rulemaking under this subsection shall be in
accordance with the procedures specified in section 553 of title
5, United States Code, for rulemaking not on the record.
(B) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair
or limit the Commission’s power to make, or to modify or alter
the procedures the Commission may follow in making, rules
and regulations pursuant to any other authority under this
title.(C) Any amendment to the rules of a self-regulatory orga-
nization made by the Commission pursuant to this subsection
shall be considered for all purposes of this title to be part of
the rules of such self-regulatory organization and shall not be
considered to be a rule of the Commission.
(5) With respect to rules described in subsection (b)(5), the
Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
Secretary of the Treasury before abrogating, adding to, and de-
leting from such rules, except where the Commission deter-
mines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or sum-
mary action and publishes its reasons therefor.
(d)(1) If any self-regulatory organization imposes any final dis-
ciplinary sanction on any member thereof or participant therein,
denies membership or participation to any applicant, or prohibits
or limits any person in respect to access to services offered by such
organization or member thereof or if any self-regulatory organiza-

propriate regulatory agency for the self-regulatory organization and
(if other than the appropriate regulatory agency for the self-regu-
latory organization) the appropriate regulatory agency for such
member, participant, applicant, or other person. The notice shall be
in such form and contain such information as the appropriate regu-
latory agency for the self-regulatory organization, by rule, may pre-
scribe as necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes
of this title.
(2) Any action with respect to which a self-regulatory organiza-
tion is required by paragraph (1) of this subsection to file notice
shall be subject to review by the appropriate regulatory agency for
such member, participant, applicant, or other person, on its own
motion, or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby filed
within thirty days after the date such notice was filed with such
appropriate regulatory agency and received by such aggrieved per-
son, or within such longer period as such appropriate regulatory
agency may determine. Application to such appropriate regulatory
agency for review, or the institution of review by such appropriate
regulatory agency on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay
of such action unless such appropriate regulatory agency otherwise
orders, summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing on
the question of a stay (which hearing may consist solely of the sub-
mission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments). Each ap-
propriate regulatory agency shall establish for appropriate cases an
expedited procedure for consideration and determination of the
question of a stay.
(3) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to an exchange
registered pursuant to section 6(g) of this title or a national securi-
ties association registered pursuant to section 15A(k) of this title
only to the extent that such exchange or association imposes any
final disciplinary sanction for—
(A) a violation of the Federal securities laws or the rules
and regulations thereunder; or
(B) a violation of a rule of such exchange or association, as
to which a proposed change would be required to be filed under
section 19 of this title, except that, to the extent that the ex-
change or association rule violation relates to any account,
agreement, contract, or transaction, this subsection shall apply
only to the extent such violation involves a security futures
product.
(e)(1) In any proceeding to review a final disciplinary sanction
imposed by a self-regulatory organization on a member thereof or
participant therein or a person associated with such a member,
after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may con-
sist solely of consideration of the record before the self-regulatory
organization and opportunity for the presentation of supporting
reasons to affirm, modify, or set aside the sanction)—
(A) if the appropriate regulatory agency for such member,
participant, or person associated with a member finds that
such member, participant, or person associated with a member
has engaged in such acts or practices, or has omitted such acts,

or regulations thereunder, the rules of the self-regulatory orga-
nization, or, in the case of a registered securities association,
the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as
have been specified in the determination of the self-regulatory
organization, and that such provisions are, and were applied in
a manner, consistent with the purposes of this title, such ap-
propriate regulatory agency, by order, shall so declare and, as
appropriate, affirm the sanction imposed by the self-regulatory
organization, modify the sanction in accordance with para-
graph (2) of this subsection, or remand to the self-regulatory
organization for further proceedings; or
(B) if such appropriate regulatory agency does not make
any such finding it shall, by order, set aside the sanction im-
posed by the self-regulatory organization and, if appropriate,
remand to the self-regulatory organization for further pro-
ceedings.
(2) If the appropriate regulatory agency for a member, partici-
pant, or person associated with a member, having due regard for
the public interest and the protection of investors, finds after a pro-
ceeding in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection that a
sanction imposed by a self-regulatory organization upon such mem-
ber, participant, or person associated with a member imposes any
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the proposes of this title or is excessive or oppressive, the appro-
priate regulatory agency may cancel, reduce, or require the remis-
sion of such sanction.
(f) In any proceeding to review the denial of membership or
participation in a self-regulatory organization to any applicant, the
barring of any person from becoming associated with a member of
a self-regulatory organization, or the prohibition or limitation by a
self-regulatory organization of any person with respect to access to
services offered by the self-regulatory organization or any member
thereof, if the appropriate regulatory agency for such applicant or
person, after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing
may consist solely of consideration of the record before the self-reg-
ulatory organization and opportunity for the presentation of sup-
porting reasons to dismiss the proceeding or set aside the action of
the self-regulatory organization) finds that the specific grounds on
which such denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation is based exist
in fact, that such denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation is in ac-
cordance with the rules of the self-regulatory organization, and
that such rules are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with
the purposes of this title, such appropriate regulatory agency, by
order, shall dismiss the proceeding. If such appropriate regulatory
agency does not make any such finding or if it finds that such de-
nial, bar, or prohibition or limitation imposes any burden on com-
petition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes
of this title, such appropriate regulatory agency, by order, shall set
aside the action of the self-regulatory organization and require it
to admit such applicant to membership or participation, permit
such person to become associated with a member, or grant such
person access to services offered by the self-regulatory organization
or member thereof.

INVESTIGATIONS; INJUNCTIONS AND PROSECUTION OF OFFENSES
S EC. 21. ø78u¿ (a)(1) The Commission may, in its discretion,
make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine
whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate
any provision of this title, the rules or regulations thereunder, the
rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities asso-
ciation of which such person is a member or a person associated,
or, as to any act or practice, or omission to act, while associated
with a member, formerly associated with a member, the rules of a
registered clearing agency in which such person is a participant, or,
as to any act or practice, or omission to act, while a participant,
was a participant, the rules of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, of which such person is a registered public ac-
counting firm, a person associated with such a firm, or, as to any
act, practice, or omission to act, while associated with such firm,
a person formerly associated with such a firm, or the rules of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and may require or per-
mit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath
or otherwise as the Commission shall determine, as to all the facts
and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. The
Commission is authorized in its discretion, to publish information
concerning any such violations, and to investigate any facts, condi-
tions, practices, or matters which it may deem necessary or proper
to aid in the enforcement of such provisions, in the prescribing of
rules and regulations under this title, or in securing information to
serve as a basis for recommending further legislation concerning
the matters to which this title relates.
(2) On request from a foreign securities authority, the Commis-
sion may provide assistance in accordance with this paragraph if
the requesting authority states that the requesting authority is
conducting an investigation which it deems necessary to determine
whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate
any laws or rules relating to securities matters that the requesting
authority administers or enforces. The Commission may, in its dis-
cretion, conduct such investigation as the Commission deems nec-
essary to collect information and evidence pertinent to the request
for assistance. Such assistance may be provided without regard to
whether the facts stated in the request would also constitute a vio-
lation of the laws of the United States. In deciding whether to pro-
vide such assistance, the Commission shall consider whether (A)
the requesting authority has agreed to provide reciprocal assistance

ceeding under this title, any member of the Commission or any offi-
cer designated by it is empowered to administer oaths and affirma-
tions, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence,
and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence,
memoranda, or other records which the Commission deems rel-
evant or material to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and
the production of any such records may be required from any place
in the United States or any State at any designated place of hear-
ing.
(c) In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena
issued to, any person, the Commission may invoke the aid of any
court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such in-
vestigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person re-
sides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testi-
mony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspond-
ence, memoranda, and other records. And such court may issue an
order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or
member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce
records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter
under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such
order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt
thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial
district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may
be found. Any person who shall, without just cause, fail or refuse
to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce
books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and other records, if in
his power so to do, in obedience to the subpoena of the Commis-
sion, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall
be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or to imprisonment for
a term of not more than one year, or both.

person is engaged or is about to engage in acts or practices consti-

istered securities association of which such person is a member or
a person associated with a member, the rules of a registered clear-
ing agency in which such person is a participant, the rules of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, of which such person
is a registered public accounting firm or a person associated with
such a firm, or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board, it may in its discretion bring an action in the proper district
court of the United States, the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia, or the United States courts of any territory
or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to en-
join such acts or practices, and upon a proper showing a permanent
or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted with-
out bond. The Commission may transmit such evidence as may be
available concerning such acts or practices as may constitute a vio-
lation of any provision of this title or the rules or regulations there-

(7)(A) Following the expiration of the period of delay of notifi-
cation ordered by the court pursuant to paragraph (4) of this sub-
section, the customer may, upon motion, reopen the proceeding in
the district court which issued the order. If the presiding judge or
magistrate finds that the movant is the customer to whom the
records obtained by the Commission pertain, and that the Commis-
sion has obtained financial records or information contained there-
in in violation of this subsection, other than paragraph (1), it may
order that the customer be granted civil penalties against the Com-
mission in an amount equal to the sum of—
(i) $100 without regard to the volume of records involved;
(ii) any out-of-pocket damages sustained by the customer
as a direct result of the disclosure; and
(iii) if the violation is found to have been willful, inten-
tional, and without good faith, such punitive damages as the
court may allow, together with the costs of the action and rea-
sonable attorney’s fees as determined by the court.
(B) Upon a finding that the Commission has obtained financial
records or information contained therein in violation of this sub-
section, other than paragraph (1), the court, in its discretion, may
also or in the alternative issue injunctive relief to require the Com-
mission to comply with this subsection with respect to any subpena
which the Commission issues in the future for financial records of
such customer for purposes of the same investigation.
(C) Whenever the court determines that the Commission has
failed to comply with this subsection, other than paragraph (1), and
the court finds that the circumstances raise questions of whether
an officer or employee of the Commission acted in a willful and in-
tentional manner and without good faith with respect to the viola-
tion, the Office of Personnel Management shall promptly initiate a
proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted
against the agent or employee who was primarily responsible for
the violation. After investigating and considering the evidence sub-
mitted, the Office of Personnel Management shall submit its find-
ings and recommendations to the Commission and shall send cop-
ies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee
or his representative. The Commission shall take the corrective ac-
tion that the Office of Personnel Management recommends.
(8) The relief described in paragraphs (7) and (10) shall be the
only remedies or sanctions available to a customer for a violation
of this subsection, other than paragraph (1), and nothing herein or
in the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 shall be deemed to
prohibit the use in any investigation or proceeding of financial
records, or the information contained therein, obtained by a sub-
pena issued by the Commission. In the case of an unsuccessful ac-
tion under paragraph (7), the court shall award the costs of the ac-
tion and attorney’s fees to the Commission if the presiding judge
or magistrate finds that the customer’s claims were made in bad
faith.

information contained therein to any government authority if the

(B) The Commission may, without notice to the customer pur-

records or information transferred by the Commission to the De-

provisions of this subparagraph may be disclosed or used only in
an administrative, civil, or criminal action or investigation by the
Department of Justice or the State securities agency which arises
out of or relates to the acts, practices, or courses of conduct inves-
tigated by the Commission, except that if the Department of Jus-
tice or the State securities agency determines that the information
should be disclosed or used for any other purpose, it may do so if
it notifies the customer, except as otherwise provided in the Right
to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, within 30 days of its determina-
tion, or complies with the requirements of section 1109 of such Act
regarding delay of notice.

subject to the procedures and penalties applicable to the Commis-

Commission may obtain financial records from a financial institu-
tion or transfer such records in accordance with provisions of the
Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978.
(12) Nothing in this subsection shall enlarge or restrict any
rights of a financial institution to challenge requests for records
made by the Commission under existing law. Nothing in this sub-
section shall entitle a customer to assert any rights of a financial
institution.
(13) Unless the context otherwise requires, all terms defined in
the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 which are common to
this subsection shall have the same meaning as in such Act.

action on or through the facilities of a national securities ex-
change or from or through a broker or dealer, and which is not
part of a public offering by an issuer of securities other than
standardized options or security futures products, the Commis-
sion— (A) may bring an action in a United States district
court to seek, and the court shall have jurisdiction to im-
pose, a civil penalty to be paid by the person who com-
mitted such violation; and
(B) may, subject to subsection (b)(1), bring an action in
a United States district court to seek, and the court shall

a person who, at the time of the violation, directly or indi-
rectly controlled the person who committed such violation.
(2) AMOUNT OF PENALTY FOR PERSON WHO COMMITTED VIO-
LATION.—The amount of the penalty which may be imposed on
the person who committed such violation shall be determined
by the court in light of the facts and circumstances, but shall
not exceed three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a
result of such unlawful purchase, sale, or communication.
(3) A MOUNT OF PENALTY FOR CONTROLLING PERSON.—The
amount of the penalty which may be imposed on any person
who, at the time of the violation, directly or indirectly con-
trolled the person who committed such violation, shall be de-
termined by the court in light of the facts and circumstances,
but shall not exceed the greater of $1,000,000, or three times
the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of
such controlled person’s violation. If such controlled person’s
violation was a violation by communication, the profit gained
or loss avoided as a result of the violation shall, for purposes
of this paragraph only, be deemed to be limited to the profit
gained or loss avoided by the person or persons to whom the
controlled person directed such communication.
(b) LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.—
(1) LIABILITY OF CONTROLLING PERSONS.—No controlling
person shall be subject to a penalty under subsection (a)(1)(B)
unless the Commission establishes that—
(A) such controlling person knew or recklessly dis-
regarded the fact that such controlled person was likely to
engage in the act or acts constituting the violation and
failed to take appropriate steps to prevent such act or acts
before they occurred; or
(B) such controlling person knowingly or recklessly
failed to establish, maintain, or enforce any policy or pro-
cedure required under section 15(f) of this title or section
204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and such fail-
ure substantially contributed to or permitted the occur-
rence of the act or acts constituting the violation.
(2) ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON LIABILITY.—No person
shall be subject to a penalty under subsection (a) solely by rea-
son of employing another person who is subject to a penalty
under such subsection, unless such employing person is liable

graph.
(ii) CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS.—If more than one ac-
tion on behalf of a class asserting substantially the
same claim or claims arising under this title has been
filed, and any party has sought to consolidate those
actions for pretrial purposes or for trial, the court
shall not make the determination required by clause
(i) until after the decision on the motion to consolidate
is rendered. As soon as practicable after such decision
is rendered, the court shall appoint the most adequate
plaintiff as lead plaintiff for the consolidated actions
in accordance with this paragraph.
(iii) REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION.—
(I) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subclause (II), for
purposes of clause (i), the court shall adopt a pre-
sumption that the most adequate plaintiff in any
private action arising under this title is the per-
son or group of persons that—
(aa) has either filed the complaint or
made a motion in response to a notice under
subparagraph (A)(i);
(bb) in the determination of the court, has
the largest financial interest in the relief
sought by the class; and
(cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements
of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-
dure.
(II) REBUTTAL EVIDENCE.—The presumption
described in subclause (I) may be rebutted only
upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff
class that the presumptively most adequate plain-
tiff— (aa) will not fairly and adequately protect
the interests of the class; or
(bb) is subject to unique defenses that
render such plaintiff incapable of adequately
representing the class.
(iv) DISCOVERY.—For purposes of this subpara-
graph, discovery relating to whether a member or
members of the purported plaintiff class is the most
adequate plaintiff may be conducted by a plaintiff only
if the plaintiff first demonstrates a reasonable basis
for a finding that the presumptively most adequate
plaintiff is incapable of adequately representing the
class.
(v) SELECTION OF LEAD COUNSEL.—The most ade-
quate plaintiff shall, subject to the approval of the
court, select and retain counsel to represent the class.
(vi) RESTRICTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL PLAINTIFFS.—
Except as the court may otherwise permit, consistent
with the purposes of this section, a person may be a
lead plaintiff, or an officer, director, or fiduciary of a
lead plaintiff, in no more than 5 securities class ac-

tions brought as plaintiff class actions pursuant to the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure during any 3-year pe-
riod.
(4) RECOVERY BY PLAINTIFFS.—The share of any final judg-
ment or of any settlement that is awarded to a representative
party serving on behalf of a class shall be equal, on a per share
basis, to the portion of the final judgment or settlement award-
ed to all other members of the class. Nothing in this paragraph
shall be construed to limit the award of reasonable costs and
expenses (including lost wages) directly relating to the rep-
resentation of the class to any representative party serving on
behalf of a class.
(5) RESTRICTIONS ON SETTLEMENTS UNDER SEAL.—The
terms and provisions of any settlement agreement of a class
action shall not be filed under seal, except that on motion of
any party to the settlement, the court may order filing under
seal for those portions of a settlement agreement as to which
good cause is shown for such filing under seal. For purposes of
this paragraph, good cause shall exist only if publication of a
term or provision of a settlement agreement would cause direct
and substantial harm to any party.
(6) RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENT OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND
EXPENSES.—Total attorneys’ fees and expenses awarded by the
court to counsel for the plaintiff class shall not exceed a rea-
sonable percentage of the amount of any damages and prejudg-
ment interest actually paid to the class.

damages per share that would be recoverable if the
plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged under this
title, a statement from each settling party concerning
the issue or issues on which the parties disagree.
(iii) INADMISSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES.—A

concerning the amount of damages shall not be admis-
sible in any Federal or State judicial action or admin-
istrative proceeding, other than an action or pro-
ceeding arising out of such statement.

plaining the reasons why the parties are proposing the set-
tlement.

may be required by the court.
(8) SECURITY FOR PAYMENT OF COSTS IN CLASS ACTIONS.—
In any private action arising under this title that is certified
as a class action pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-
dure, the court may require an undertaking from the attorneys
for the plaintiff class, the plaintiff class, or both, or from the
attorneys for the defendant, the defendant, or both, in such
proportions and at such times as the court determines are just
and equitable, for the payment of fees and expenses that may
be awarded under this subsection.
(9) A TTORNEY CONFLICT OF INTEREST.—If a plaintiff class
is represented by an attorney who directly owns or otherwise
has a beneficial interest in the securities that are the subject
of the litigation, the court shall make a determination of
whether such ownership or other interest constitutes a conflict
of interest sufficient to disqualify the attorney from rep-
resenting the plaintiff class.
(b) R EQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITIES FRAUD ACTIONS.—
(1) MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS.—In any pri-
vate action arising under this title in which the plaintiff al-
leges that the defendant—

to make the statements made, in the light of the cir-
cumstances in which they were made, not misleading;
the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have
been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is
misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or
omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall
state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.

giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted
with the required state of mind.
(B) EXCEPTION.—In the case of an action for money
damages brought against a credit rating agency or a con-
trolling person under this title, it shall be sufficient, for
purposes of pleading any required state of mind in relation

facts giving rise to a strong inference that the credit rating
agency knowingly or recklessly failed—
(i) to conduct a reasonable investigation of the
rated security with respect to the factual elements re-
lied upon by its own methodology for evaluating credit
risk; or
(ii) to obtain reasonable verification of such fac-
tual elements (which verification may be based on a
sampling technique that does not amount to an audit)
from other sources that the credit rating agency con-
sidered to be competent and that were independent of
the issuer and underwriter.
(3) MOTION TO DISMISS; STAY OF DISCOVERY.—
(A) DISMISSAL FOR FAILURE TO MEET PLEADING RE-

and (2) are not met.
(B) STAY OF DISCOVERY.—In any private action arising
under this title, all discovery and other proceedings shall
be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss,
unless the court finds upon the motion of any party that
particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence
or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.
(C) PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—During the pendency of any stay
of discovery pursuant to this paragraph, unless other-
wise ordered by the court, any party to the action with
actual notice of the allegations contained in the com-
plaint shall treat all documents, data compilations (in-
cluding electronically recorded or stored data), and
tangible objects that are in the custody or control of
such person and that are relevant to the allegations,
as if they were the subject of a continuing request for
production of documents from an opposing party under
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

dispositive motion.
(2) MANDATORY SANCTIONS.—If the court makes a finding
under paragraph (1) that a party or attorney violated any re-
quirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
as to any complaint, responsive pleading, or dispositive motion,
the court shall impose sanctions on such party or attorney in
accordance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-
dure. Prior to making a finding that any party or attorney has
violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the
court shall give such party or attorney notice and an oppor-
tunity to respond.
(3) PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND
COSTS.—
(A) I N GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraphs (B) and
(C), for purposes of paragraph (2), the court shall adopt a
presumption that the appropriate sanction—
(i) for failure of any responsive pleading or dis-
positive motion to comply with any requirement of
Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is
an award to the opposing party of the reasonable at-
torneys’ fees and other expenses incurred as a direct
result of the violation; and
(ii) for substantial failure of any complaint to com-
ply with any requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure is an award to the opposing
party of the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other ex-
penses incurred in the action.
(B) REBUTTAL EVIDENCE.—The presumption described
in subparagraph (A) may be rebutted only upon proof by
the party or attorney against whom sanctions are to be im-
posed that—
(i) the award of attorneys’ fees and other expenses
will impose an unreasonable burden on that party or
attorney and would be unjust, and the failure to make
such an award would not impose a greater burden on

of Civil Procedure was de minimis.

(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), in
any private action arising under this title in which the plaintiff
seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of
a security, the award of damages to the plaintiff shall not ex-
ceed the difference between the purchase or sale price paid or
received, as appropriate, by the plaintiff for the subject secu-
rity and the mean trading price of that security during the 90-
day period beginning on the date on which the information cor-
recting the misstatement or omission that is the basis for the
action is disseminated to the market.
(2) EXCEPTION.—In any private action arising under this
title in which the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by ref-
erence to the market price of a security, if the plaintiff sells or
repurchases the subject security prior to the expiration of the
90-day period described in paragraph (1), the plaintiff’s dam-
ages shall not exceed the difference between the purchase or
sale price paid or received, as appropriate, by the plaintiff for
the security and the mean trading price of the security during
the period beginning immediately after dissemination of infor-
mation correcting the misstatement or omission and ending on
the date on which the plaintiff sells or repurchases the secu-
rity.
(3) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this subsection, the
‘‘mean trading price’’ of a security shall be an average of the
daily trading price of that security, determined as of the close
of the market each day during the 90-day period referred to in
paragraph (1).
(f) PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.—
(1) APPLICABILITY.—Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to create, affect, or in any manner modify, the stand-
ard for liability associated with any action arising under the

instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories, or if
there is no jury, shall make findings, with respect to each
covered person and each of the other persons claimed by
any of the parties to have caused or contributed to the loss
incurred by the plaintiff, including persons who have en-
tered into settlements with the plaintiff or plaintiffs, con-
cerning—
(i) whether such person violated the securities
laws;
(ii) the percentage of responsibility of such person,
measured as a percentage of the total fault of all per-
sons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by
the plaintiff; and

violation of the securities laws.

INGS.—The responses to interrogatories, or findings, as ap-
propriate, under subparagraph (A) shall specify the total
amount of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to recover
and the percentage of responsibility of each covered person
found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by
the plaintiff or plaintiffs.
(C) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—In determining the
percentage of responsibility under this paragraph, the trier
of fact shall consider—
(i) the nature of the conduct of each covered per-
son found to have caused or contributed to the loss in-
curred by the plaintiff or plaintiffs; and

ship between the conduct of each such person and the
damages incurred by the plaintiff or plaintiffs.
(4) UNCOLLECTIBLE SHARE.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(B),
upon motion made not later than 6 months after a final

ments required pursuant to subparagraph (A) exceed the

ally pursuant to paragraph (2)(A);

(7) SETTLEMENT DISCHARGE.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—A covered person who settles any
private action at any time before final verdict or judgment
shall be discharged from all claims for contribution
brought by other persons. Upon entry of the settlement by
the court, the court shall enter a bar order constituting the
final discharge of all obligations to the plaintiff of the set-
tling covered person arising out of the action. The order
shall bar all future claims for contribution arising out of
the action—
(i) by any person against the settling covered per-
son; and
(ii) by the settling covered person against any per-
son, other than a person whose liability has been ex-
tinguished by the settlement of the settling covered
person.
(B) REDUCTION.—If a covered person enters into a set-
tlement with the plaintiff prior to final verdict or judg-
ment, the verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the
greater of—
(i) an amount that corresponds to the percentage
of responsibility of that covered person; or
(ii) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that cov-
ered person.
(8) CONTRIBUTION.—A covered person who becomes jointly
and severally liable for damages in any private action may re-
cover contribution from any other person who, if joined in the
original action, would have been liable for the same damages.
A claim for contribution shall be determined based on the per-
centage of responsibility of the claimant and of each person
against whom a claim for contribution is made.
(9) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CONTRIBUTION.—In any
private action determining liability, an action for contribution
shall be brought not later than 6 months after the entry of a
final, nonappealable judgment in the action, except that an ac-
tion for contribution brought by a covered person who was re-
quired to make an additional payment pursuant to paragraph
(4) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date on
which such payment was made.
(10) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this subsection—

edge that the representation is false, or omits to
state a fact necessary in order to make the state-
ment made not misleading, with actual knowledge

(F) any State securities or law enforcement authority.
(2) NONDISCLOSURE OF PRIVILEGED INFORMATION PROVIDED

curities authority, or foreign law enforcement authority, if the

COURT REVIEW OF ORDERS AND RULES
S EC. 25. ø78y¿ (a)(1) A person aggrieved by a final order of the
Commission entered pursuant to this title may obtain review of the
order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which
he resides or has his principal place of business, or for the District
of Columbia Circuit, by filing in such court, within sixty days after
the entry of the order, a written petition requesting that the order
be modified or set aside in whole or in part.
(2) A copy of the petition shall be transmitted forthwith by the
clerk of the court to a member of the Commission or an officer des-
ignated by the Commission for that purpose. Thereupon the Com-
mission shall file in the court the record on which the order com-
plained of is entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United
States Code, and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
(3) On the filing of the petition, the court has jurisdiction,
which becomes exclusive on the filing of the record, to affirm or
modify and enforce or to set aside the order in whole or in part.
(4) The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported
by substantial evidence, are conclusive.
(5) If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce addi-
tional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the
additional evidence is material and that there was reasonable
ground for failure to adduce it before the Commission, the court
may remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings,
in whatever manner and on whatever conditions the court con-
siders appropriate. If the case is remanded to the Commission, it
shall file in the court a supplemental record containing any new
evidence, any further or modified findings, and any new order.
(b)(1) A person adversely affected by a rule of the Commission
promulgated pursuant to section 6, 9(h)(2), 11, 11A, 15(c) (5) or (6),
15A, 17, 17A, or 19 of this title may obtain review of this rule in
the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which he re-
sides or has his principal place of business or for the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the
promulgation of the rule, a written petition requesting that the
rule be set aside.
(2) A copy of the petition shall be transmitted forthwith by the
clerk of the court to a member of the Commission or an officer des-
ignated for that purpose. Thereupon, the Commission shall file in
the court the rule under review and any documents referred to
therein, the Commission’s notice of proposed rulemaking and any
documents referred to therein, all written submissions and the
transcript of any oral presentations in the rulemaking, factual in-
formation not included in the foregoing that was considered by the
Commission in the promulgation of the rule or proffered by the
Commission as pertinent to the rule, the report of any advisory

committee received or considered by the Commission in the rule-
making, and any other materials prescribed by the court.
(3) On the filing of the petition, the court has jurisdiction,
which becomes exclusive on the filing of the materials set forth in
paragraph (2) of this subsection, to affirm and enforce or to set
aside the rule.
(4) The findings of the Commission as to the facts identified by
the Commission as the basis, in whole or in part, of the rule, if sup-
ported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. The court shall af-
firm and enforce the rule unless the Commission’s action in pro-
mulgating the rule is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to con-
stitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of statu-
tory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory
right; or without observance of procedure required by law.
(5) If proceedings have been instituted under this subsection in
two or more courts of appeals with respect to the same rule, the
Commission shall file the materials set forth in paragraph (2) of
this subsection in that court in which a proceeding was first insti-
tuted. The other courts shall thereupon transfer all such pro-
ceedings to the court in which the materials have been filed. For
the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice that court
may thereafter transfer all the proceedings to any other court of
appeals.
(c)(1) No objection to an order or rule of the Commission, for
which review is sought under this section, may be considered by
the court unless it was urged before the Commission or there was
reasonable ground for failure to do so.
(2) The filing of a petition under this section does not operate
as a stay of the Commission’s order or rule. Until the court’s juris-
diction becomes exclusive, the Commission may stay its order or
rule pending judicial review if it finds that justice so requires. After
the filing of a petition under this section, the court, on whatever
conditions may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent
irreparable injury, may issue all necessary and appropriate process
to stay the order or rule or to preserve status or rights pending its
review; but (notwithstanding section 705 of title 5, United States
Code) no such process may be issued by the court before the filing
of the record or the materials set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this
section unless: (A) the Commission has denied a stay or failed to
grant requested relief, (B) a reasonable period has expired since
the filing of an application for a stay without a decision by the
Commission, or (C) there was reasonable ground for failure to
apply to the Commission.
(3) When the same order or rule is the subject of one or more
petitions for review filed under this section and an action for en-
forcement filed in a district court of the United States under sec-
tion 21 (d) or (e) of this title, that court in which the petition or
the action is first filed has jurisdiction with respect to the order or
rule to the exclusion of any other court, and thereupon all such
proceedings shall be transferred to that court; but, for the conven-
ience of the parties in the interest of justice, that court may there-
after transfer all the proceedings to any other court of appeals or
district court of the United States, whether or not a petition for re-

view or an action for enforcement was originally filed in the trans-
feree court. The scope of review by a district court under section
21 (d) or (e) of this title is in all cases the same as by a court of
appeals under this section.
(d)(1) For purposes of the preceding subsections of this section,
the term ‘‘Commission’’ includes the agencies enumerated in sec-
tion 3(a)(34) of this title insofar as such agencies are acting pursu-
ant to this title and the Secretary of the Treasury insofar as he is
acting pursuant to section 15C of this title.
(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(4) of this section and section
706 of title 5, United States Code, an order of the Commission pur-
suant to section 19(a) of this title denying registration to a clearing
agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory
agency or pursuant to section 19(b) of this title disapproving a pro-
posed rule change by such a clearing agency shall be deemed to be
an order of the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing
agency insofar as such order was entered by reason of a determina-
tion by such appropriate regulatory agency pursuant to section
19(a)(2)(C) or 19(b)(4)(C) of this title that such registration or pro-
posed rule change would be inconsistent with the safeguarding of
securities or funds.
UNLAWFUL REPRESENTATIONS
SEC. 26. ø78z¿ No action or failure to act by the Commission
or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in the
administration of this title shall be construed to mean that the par-
ticular authority has in any way passed upon the merits of, or
given approval to, any security or any transaction or transactions
therein, nor shall such action or failure to act with regard to any
statement or report filed with or examined by such authority pur-
suant to this title or rules and regulations thereunder, be deemed
a finding by such authority that such statement or report is true
and accurate on its face or that it is not false or misleading. It shall
be unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective pur-
chaser or seller of a security any representation that any such ac-
tion or failure to act by any such authority is to be so construed
or has such effect.

force any liability or duty created by this title or the rules and reg-
ulations thereunder. Any criminal proceeding may be brought in
the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the viola-
tion occurred. Any suit or action to enforce any liability or duty cre-
ated by this title or rules and regulations thereunder, or to enjoin
any violation of such title or rules and regulations, may be brought
in any such district or in the district wherein the defendant is
found or is an inhabitant or transacts business, and process in such

cases may be served in any other district of which the defendant
is an inhabitant or wherever the defendant may be found. In any
action or proceeding instituted by the Commission under this title
in a United States district court for any judicial district, a sub-
poena issued to compel the attendance of a witness or the produc-
tion of documents or tangible things (or both) at a hearing or trial
may be served at any place within the United States. Rule
45(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall not
apply to a subpoena issued under the preceding sentence. Judg-
ments and decrees so rendered shall be subject to review as pro-
vided in sections 1254, 1291, 1292, and 1294 of title 28, United
States Code. No costs shall be assessed for or against the Commis-
sion in any proceeding under this title brought by or against it in
the Supreme Court or such other courts.
(b) EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION.—The district courts of the
United States and the United States courts of any Territory shall
have jurisdiction of an action or proceeding brought or instituted
by the Commission or the United States alleging a violation of the
antifraud provisions of this title involving—
(1) conduct within the United States that constitutes sig-
nificant steps in furtherance of the violation, even if the securi-
ties transaction occurs outside the United States and involves
only foreign investors; or
(2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has a
foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.
SPECIAL PROVISION RELATING TO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON
PRIVATE CAUSES OF ACTION

TION.—The limitation period for any private civil action implied

civil action implied under section 10(b) of this Act that was com-
menced on or before June 19, 1991—

diction of the securities commission (or any agency or officer
performing like functions) of any State over any security or
any person insofar as it does not conflict with the provisions
of this title or the rules and regulations under this title.

bility. A security-based swap may not be regulated as an insur-
ance contract under any provision of State law.
(b) Nothing in this title shall be construed to modify existing
law with regard to the binding effect (1) on any member of or par-
ticipant in any self-regulatory organization of any action taken by

(d) No State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any
tax on any change in beneficial or record ownership of securities ef-
fected through the facilities of a registered clearing agency or reg-
istered transfer agent or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor
or upon the delivery or transfer of securities to or through or re-
ceipt from such agency or agent or any nominee thereof or custo-
dian therefor, unless such change in beneficial or record ownership
or such transfer or delivery or receipt would otherwise be taxable
by such State or political subdivision if the facilities of such reg-
istered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee
thereof or custodian therefor were not physically located in the tax-
ing State or political subdivision. No State or political subdivision
thereof shall impose any tax on securities which are deposited in
or retained by a registered clearing agency, registered transfer
agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor, unless such
securities would otherwise be taxable by such State or political sub-
division if the facilities of such registered clearing agency, reg-
istered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor

sion.(e)(1) No person using the mails, or any means or instrumen-
tality of interstate commerce, in the exercise of investment discre-

lawfully or to have breached a fiduciary duty under State or Fed-
eral law unless expressly provided to the contrary by a law enacted
by the Congress or any State subsequent to the date of enactment
of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 solely by reason of his
having caused the account to pay a member of an exchange, broker,
or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities trans-
action in excess of the amount of commission another member of
an exchange, broker, or dealer would have charged for effecting
that transaction, if such person determined in good faith that such
amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research services provided by such member,
broker, or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular trans-
action or his overall responsibilities with respect to the accounts as
to which he exercises investment discretion. This subsection is ex-
clusive and plenary insofar as conduct is covered by the foregoing,
unless otherwise expressly provided by contract: Provided, however,
That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or
limit the power of the Commission under any other provision of
this title or otherwise.
(2) A person exercising investment discretion with respect to
an account shall make such disclosure of his policies and practices
with respect to commissions that will be paid for effecting securi-

priate regulatory agency, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or ap-
propriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

sions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code,

partment of Justice’s present enforcement policy regarding the pre-
ceding provisions of this section. The Attorney General shall, with-
in 30 days after receiving such a request, issue an opinion in re-
sponse to that request. The opinion shall state whether or not cer-
tain specified prospective conduct would, for purposes of the De-
partment of Justice’s present enforcement policy, violate the pre-

conduct, which is specified in a request by an issuer and for which

in conformity with the Department of Justice’s present enforcement
policy, is in compliance with the preceding provisions of this sec-
tion. Such a presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of
the evidence. In considering the presumption for purposes of this
paragraph, a court shall weigh all relevant factors, including but
not limited to whether the information submitted to the Attorney
General was accurate and complete and whether it was within the
scope of the conduct specified in any request received by the Attor-
ney General. The Attorney General shall establish the procedure

title.(2) Any document or other material which is provided to, re-

5, United States Code, and shall not, except with the consent of the
issuer, be made publicly available, regardless of whether the Attor-
ney General responds to such a request or the issuer withdraws
such request before receiving a response.

ticable, provide timely guidance concerning the Department of Jus-
tice’s present enforcement policy with respect to the preceding pro-
visions of this section to potential exporters and small businesses

tential liabilities under the preceding provisions of this section.

(1) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.—Subject to subsections (i)(1)(B)
and (k), for each fiscal year, the Commission shall by order ad-
just each of the rates applicable under subsections (b) and (c)
for such fiscal year to a uniform adjusted rate that, when ap-
plied to the baseline estimate of the aggregate dollar amount
of sales for such fiscal year, is reasonably likely to produce ag-
gregate fee collections under this section (including assess-
ments collected under subsection (d) of this section) that are
equal to the regular appropriation to the Commission by Con-
gress for such fiscal year.
(2) MID-YEAR ADJUSTMENT.—Subject to subsections (i)(1)(B)
and (k), for each fiscal year, the Commission shall determine,
by March 1 of such fiscal year, whether, based on the actual
aggregate dollar volume of sales during the first 5 months of
such fiscal year, the baseline estimate of the aggregate dollar
volume of sales used under paragraph (1) for such fiscal year
is reasonably likely to be 10 percent (or more) greater or less
than the actual aggregate dollar volume of sales for such fiscal
year. If the Commission so determines, the Commission shall
by order, no later than March 1, adjust each of the rates appli-
cable under subsections (b) and (c) for such fiscal year to a uni-
form adjusted rate that, when applied to the revised estimate
of the aggregate dollar amount of sales for the remainder of
such fiscal year, is reasonably likely to produce aggregate fee
collections under this section (including fees collected during
such five-month period and assessments collected under sub-
section (d) of this section) that are equal to the regular appro-
priation to the Commission by Congress for such fiscal year. In
making such revised estimate, the Commission shall, after con-
sultation with the Congressional Budget Office and the Office
of Management and Budget, use the same methodology re-
quired by subsection (l).

adjusted rate prescribed under paragraph (1) or (2) and pub-
lished under subsection (g) shall not be subject to judicial re-
view.
(4) EFFECTIVE DATE.—
(A) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.—Subject to subsections
(i)(1)(B) and (k), an adjusted rate prescribed under para-
graph (1) shall take effect on the later of—
(i) the first day of the fiscal year to which such
rate applies; or

fiscal year is enacted.
(B) MID-YEAR ADJUSTMENT.—An adjusted rate pre-
scribed under paragraph (2) shall take effect on April 1 of
the fiscal year to which such rate applies.

year a regular appropriation to the Commission has not been en-
acted, the Commission shall continue to collect (as offsetting collec-
tions) the fees and assessments under subsections (b), (c), and (d)
at the rate in effect during the preceding fiscal year, until 60 days
after the date such a regular appropriation is enacted.
(l) BASELINE ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF
SALES.—The baseline estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of
sales for any fiscal year is the baseline estimate of the aggregate
dollar amount of sales of securities (other than bonds, debentures,
other evidences of indebtedness, security futures products, and op-
tions on securities indexes (excluding a narrow-based security
index)) to be transacted on each national securities exchange and
by or through any member of each national securities association
(otherwise than on a national securities exchange) during such fis-
cal year as determined by the Commission, after consultation with
the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and
Budget, using the methodology required for making projections
pursuant to section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act of 1985.
(m) TRANSMITTAL OF COMMISSION BUDGET REQUESTS.—
(1) BUDGET REQUIRED.—For fiscal year 2012, and each fis-
cal year thereafter, the Commission shall prepare and submit
a budget to the President. Whenever the Commission submits
a budget estimate or request to the President or the Office of
Management and Budget, the Commission shall concurrently
transmit copies of the estimate or request to the Committee on
Appropriations of the Senate, the Committee on Appropriations
of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee
