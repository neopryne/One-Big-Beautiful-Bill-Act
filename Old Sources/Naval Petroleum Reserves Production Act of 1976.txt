DESIGNATION OF THE NATIONAL PETROLEUM RESERVE IN ALASKA
SEC. 102. The area known as Naval Petroleum Reserve Num-
bered 4, Alaska, established by Executive order of the President,

ADMINISTRATION OF THE RESERVE
S EC. 104. (a) Any exploration within the Utukok River, the
Teshekpuk Lake areas, and other areas designated by the Sec-
retary of the Interior containing any significant subsistence, rec-
reational, fish and wildlife, or historical or scenic value, shall be
conducted in a manner which will assure the maximum protection
of such surface values to the extent consistent with the require-
ments of this Act for the exploration of the reserve.
(b) The Secretary of the Navy shall continue the ongoing petro-
leum exploration program within the reserve until the date of the
transfer of jurisdiction specified in section 103(a). Prior to the date
of such transfer of jurisdiction the Secretary of the Navy shall—
(1) cooperate fully with the Secretary of the Interior pro-
viding him access to such facilities and such information as he
may request to facilitate the transfer of jurisdiction;
(2) provide to the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources
of the House of Representatives copies of any reports, plans, or
contracts pertaining to the reserve that are required to be sub-
mitted to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives; and
(3) cooperate and consult with the Secretary of the Interior
before executing any new contract or amendment to any exist-
ing contract pertaining to the reserve and allow him a reason-
able opportunity to comment on such contract or amendment,
as the case may be.
(c) The Secretary of the Interior shall commence further petro-
leum exploration of the reserve as of the date of transfer of jurisdic-
tion specified in section 103(a). In conducting this exploration ef-
fort, the Secretary of the Interior—
(1) is authorized to enter into contracts for the exploration
of the reserve, except that no such contract may be entered
into until at least thirty days after the Secretary of the Interior
has provided the Attorney General with a copy of the proposed
contract and such other information as may be appropriate to
determine legal sufficiency and possible violations under, or in-
consistencies with, the antitrust laws. If, within such thirty-
day period, the Attorney General advises the Secretary of the
Interior that any such contract would unduly restrict competi-
tion or be inconsistent with the antitrust laws, then the Sec-
retary of the Interior may not execute that contract;
(2) shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Re-
sources of the House of Representatives any new plans or sub-
stantial amendments to ongoing plans for the exploration of
the reserve. All such plans or amendments submitted to such
committees pursuant to this section shall contain a report by
the Attorney General of the United States with respect to the
anticipated effects of such plans or amendments on competi-
tion. Such plans or amendments shall not be implemented
until sixty days after they have been submitted to such com-
mittees; and

long thereafter as oil or gas is produced from the lease in pay-
ing quantities, oil or gas is capable of being produced in paying
quantities, or drilling or reworking operations, as approved by
the Secretary, are conducted on the leased land.
(2) RENEWAL OF LEASES WITH DISCOVERIES.—At the end of
the primary term of a lease the Secretary shall renew for an
additional 10-year term a lease that does not meet the require-
ments of paragraph (1) if the lessee submits to the Secretary

piration of the primary lease and the lessee certifies, and the
Secretary agrees, that hydrocarbon resources were discovered
on one or more wells drilled on the leased land in such quan-
tities that a prudent operator would hold the lease for poten-
tial future development.

end of the primary term of a lease the Secretary shall renew
for an additional 10-year term a lease that does not meet the

renewal fee of $100 per acre of leased land, and—
(A) the lessee provides evidence, and the Secretary
agrees that, the lessee has diligently pursued exploration
that warrants continuation with the intent of continued
exploration or future potential development of the leased
land; or
(B) all or part of the lease—
(i) is part of a unit agreement covering a lease de-
scribed in subparagraph (A); and
(ii) has not been previously contracted out of the
unit.
(4) APPLICABILITY.—This subsection applies to a lease that
is in effect on or after the date of enactment of the Energy Pol-
icy Act of 2005.

standing any other provision of this Act, if no oil or gas is pro-
duced from a lease within 30 years after the date of the
issuance of the lease the lease shall expire.

(j) UNIT AGREEMENTS.—
(1) I N GENERAL.—For the purpose of conservation of the
natural resources of all or part of any oil or gas pool, field, res-
ervoir, or like area, lessees (including representatives) of the
pool, field, reservoir, or like area may unite with each other,
or jointly or separately with others, in collectively adopting and
operating under a unit agreement for all or part of the pool,
field, reservoir, or like area (whether or not any other part of
the oil or gas pool, field, reservoir, or like area is already sub-
ject to any cooperative or unit plan of development or oper-
ation), if the Secretary determines the action to be necessary
or advisable in the public interest. In determining the public

interest, the Secretary should consider, among other things,
the extent to which the unit agreement will minimize the im-
pact to surface resources of the leases and will facilitate con-
solidation of facilities.
(2) CONSULTATION.—In making a determination under
paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with and provide op-
portunities for participation by the State of Alaska or a Re-
gional Corporation (as defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1602)) with respect to the
creation or expansion of units that include acreage in which
the State of Alaska or the Regional Corporation has an interest
in the mineral estate.
(3) PRODUCTION ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY.—(A) The Sec-
retary may use a production allocation methodology for each
participating area within a unit that includes solely Federal
land in the Reserve.
(B) The Secretary shall use a production allocation meth-
odology for each participating area within a unit that includes
Federal land in the Reserve and non-Federal land based on the
characteristics of each specific oil or gas pool, field, reservoir,
or like area to take into account reservoir heterogeneity and
area variation in reservoir producibility across diverse lease-
hold interests. The implementation of the foregoing production
allocation methodology shall be controlled by agreement among
the affected lessors and lessees.
(4) BENEFIT OF OPERATIONS.—Drilling, production, and
well reworking operations performed in accordance with a unit
agreement shall be deemed to be performed for the benefit of
all leases that are subject in whole or in part to such unit
agreement.
(5) POOLING.—If separate tracts cannot be independently
developed and operated in conformity with an established well
spacing or development program, any lease, or a portion there-
of, may be pooled with other lands, whether or not owned by
the United States, under a communitization or drilling agree-
ment providing for an apportionment of production or royalties
among the separate tracts of land comprising the drilling or
spacing unit when determined by the Secretary of the Interior
(in consultation with the owners of the other land) to be in the
public interest, and operations or production pursuant to such
an agreement shall be deemed to be operations or production
as to each such lease committed to the agreement.
(k) EXPLORATION INCENTIVES.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—
(A) WAIVER, SUSPENSION, OR REDUCTION.—To encour-
age the greatest ultimate recovery of oil or gas or in the
interest of conservation, the Secretary may waive, sus-
pend, or reduce the rental fees or minimum royalty, or re-
duce the royalty on an entire leasehold (including on any
lease operated pursuant to a unit agreement), whenever
(after consultation with the State of Alaska and the North
Slope Borough of Alaska and the concurrence of any Re-
gional Corporation for leases that include land that was
made available for acquisition by the Regional Corporation

tion’’);
(B)(i) in a case in which a conveyance of a subsurface

the revenues reserved under the lease as to that portion,
including, without limitation, all the royalty payable with
