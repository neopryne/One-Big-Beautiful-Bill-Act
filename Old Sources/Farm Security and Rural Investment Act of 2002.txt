(ii) The 4-year average of eligible oilseed acreage
on the farm for the 1998 through 2001 crop years,
as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (2).
(2) ELIGIBLE OILSEED ACREAGE.—
(A) CALCULATION.—For purposes of paragraph
(1)(B)(ii), the eligible acreage for each oilseed on a farm
during each of the 1998 through 2001 crop years shall
be determined in the manner provided in paragraph (1)(A),
except that the total acreage for all oilseeds on the farm
for a crop year may not exceed the difference between—
(i) the total acreage determined under paragraph
(1)(A) for all covered commodities for that crop year;
and (ii) the total contract acreage determined under
paragraph (1)(B)(i).

performed under subparagraph (A) results in a negative
number, the eligible oilseed acreage on the farm for that
crop year shall be zero for purposes of determining the
4-year average.
(C) OFFSET OF CONTRACT ACREAGE.—The owner of a
farm may increase the eligible acreage for an oilseed on
the farm by reducing the contract acreage determined
under paragraph (1)(B)(i) for 1 or more covered commodities

years to covered commodities, if the acreage that was planted
or prevented from being planted was devoted to another covered
commodity in the same crop year (other than a covered com-
modity produced under an established practice of double crop-
ping), the owner may elect the commodity to be used for that

direct payments and counter-cyclical payments under this subtitle,
the Secretary shall provide for the establishment of a payment
yield for each farm for each covered commodity in accordance with
this section.
(b) USE OF FARM PROGRAM PAYMENT YIELD.—Except as other-
wise provided in this section, the payment yield for each of the
2002 through 2007 crops of a covered commodity for a farm shall
be the farm program payment yield established for the 1995 crop
of the covered commodity under section 505 of the Agricultural
Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1465), as adjusted by the Secretary to account
for any additional yield payments made with respect to that crop
under section 505(b)(2) of that Act.
(c) FARMS WITHOUT FARM PROGRAM PAYMENT YIELD.—In the
case of a farm for which a farm program payment yield is unavail-
able for a covered commodity (other than soybeans or other oilseeds),

age yield for the oilseed for the 1981 through 1985 crops
by the national average yield for the oilseed for the 1998
through 2001 crops.
(3) USE OF PARTIAL COUNTY AVERAGE YIELD.—If the yield
per planted acre for a crop of an oilseed for a farm for any
of the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent
of the county yield for that oilseed, the Secretary shall assign
a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the county
yield for the purpose of determining the average under para-
graph (1).
(e) OPPORTUNITY TO PARTIALLY UPDATE YIELDS USED TO DETER-
MINE COUNTER-CYCLICAL PAYMENTS.—
(1) ELECTION TO UPDATE.—If the owner of a farm elects
to use the base acres calculation method described in section
1101(a)(1)(A), the owner shall also have a 1-time opportunity

to partially update the payment yields that would otherwise
be used in calculating any counter-cyclical payments for covered
commodities on the farm.
(2) TIME FOR ELECTION.—The election under paragraph
(1) shall be made at the same time and in the same manner
as the Secretary prescribes for the election required under
section 1101.
(3) METHODS OF UPDATING YIELDS.—If the owner of a farm

yield for a covered commodity on the farm, for the purpose
of calculating counter-cyclical payments only, shall be equal
to the yield determined using either of the following:
(A) The sum of the following:
(i) The payment yield applicable for direct pay-
ments for the covered commodity on the farm.
(ii) 70 percent of the difference between—
(I) the average yield per planted acre for the
crop of the covered commodity on the farm for
the 1998 through 2001 crop years, as determined
by the Secretary, excluding any crop year in which
the acreage planted to the crop of the covered
commodity was zero; and
(II) the payment yield applicable for direct
payments for the covered commodity on the farm.
(B) 93.5 percent of the average of the yield per planted
acre for the crop of the covered commodity on the farm
for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, as determined by
the Secretary, excluding any crop year in which the acreage
planted to the crop of the covered commodity was zero.
(4) USE OF PARTIAL COUNTY AVERAGE YIELD.—If the yield
per planted acre for a crop of the covered commodity for a
farm for any of the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less
than 75 percent of the county yield for that commodity, the
Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75
percent of the county yield for the purpose of determining
the average yield under paragraph (3).

shall be made based on the 2001 crop quota levels and shall
take into account sales of the farm that occurred before the
date of enactment of this Act and any permanent transfers
of quota that took place before that date, consistent with the
preceding paragraphs. The Secretary shall not take into
account, or allow eligibility for, quotas for seed, granted as
experimental quotas, or obtained by temporary lease or
transfer.

eligible for payments under this section, as determined under
subsection (f), the continued eligibility of the person for the

in this paragraph as a ‘new entrant’) starts processing
sugar beets after the date of enactment of this subpara-
graph, or acquires and reopens a factory that produced
beet sugar during previous crop years that (at the
time of acquisition) has no allocation associated with
the factory under this part, the Secretary shall—
‘‘(I) assign an allocation for beet sugar to the
new entrant that provides a fair and equitable
distribution of the allocations for beet sugar; and
‘‘(II) reduce the allocations for beet sugar of
all other processors on a pro rata basis to reflect
the new allocation.
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—If a new entrant acquires and
reopens a factory that previously produced beet sugar
from sugar beets and from sugar beet molasses but
the factory last processed sugar beets during the 1997
crop year and the new entrant starts to process sugar
beets at such factory after the date of enactment of
this clause, the Secretary shall—
‘‘(I) assign an allocation for beet sugar to the
new entrant that is not less than the greater of
1.67 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted
average quantities of beet sugar produced by all
processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop
years as determined under subsection (b)(2)(C),
or 1,500,000 hundredweights; and
‘‘(II) reduce the allocations for beet sugar of
all other processors on a pro rata basis to reflect
the new allocation.
‘‘(I) NEW ENTRANTS ACQUIRING ONGOING FACTORIES
WITH PRODUCTION HISTORY.—If a new entrant acquires a
factory that has production history during the period of
the 1998 through 2000 crop years and that is producing
beet sugar at the time the allocations are made from a
processor that has an allocation of beet sugar, the Secretary
shall transfer a portion of the allocation of the seller to
the new entrant to reflect the historical contribution of
the production of the sold factory to the total allocation
of the seller.

‘‘SEC. 359e. REASSIGNMENT OF DEFICITS.
‘‘(a) ESTIMATES OF DEFICITS.—At any time allotments are in
effect under this part, the Secretary, from time to time, shall
determine whether (in view of then-current inventories of sugar,
the estimated production of sugar and expected marketings, and
other pertinent factors) any processor of sugarcane will be unable
to market the sugar covered by the portion of the State cane
sugar allotment allocated to the processor and whether any proc-
essor of sugar beets will be unable to market sugar covered by
the portion of the beet sugar allotment allocated to the processor.
‘‘(b) REASSIGNMENT OF DEFICITS.—
‘‘(1) CANE SUGAR.—If the Secretary determines that any
sugarcane processor who has been allocated a share of a State
cane sugar allotment will be unable to market the processor’s
allocation of the State’s allotment for the crop year—
‘‘(A) the Secretary first shall reassign the estimated
quantity of the deficit to the allocations for other processors
within that State, depending on the capacity of each other
processor to fill the portion of the deficit to be assigned
to it and taking into account the interests of producers
served by the processors;
‘‘(B) if after the reassignments the deficit cannot be
completely eliminated, the Secretary shall reassign the esti-
mated quantity of the deficit proportionately to the allot-
ments for other cane sugar States, depending on the
capacity of each other State to fill the portion of the deficit
to be assigned to it, with the reassigned quantity to each
State to be allocated among processors in that State in
proportion to the allocations of the processors;
‘‘(C) if after the reassignments the deficit cannot be
completely eliminated, the Secretary shall reassign the esti-
mated quantity of the deficit to the Commodity Credit
Corporation and shall sell such quantity of sugar from
inventories of the Corporation unless the Secretary deter-
mines that such sales would have a significant effect on
the price of sugar; and
‘‘(D) if after the reassignments and sales, the deficit
cannot be completely eliminated, the Secretary shall
reassign the remainder to imports.
‘‘(2) BEET SUGAR.—If the Secretary determines that a sugar
beet processor who has been allocated a share of the beet
sugar allotment will be unable to market that allocation—
‘‘(A) the Secretary first shall reassign the estimated
quantity of the deficit to the allotments for other sugar
beet processors, depending on the capacity of each other
processor to fill the portion of the deficit to be assigned

‘‘(a) PROCESSOR ASSURANCES.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—If allotments for a crop year are allocated
to processors under section 359d, the Secretary shall obtain
from the processors such assurances as the Secretary considers
adequate that the allocation will be shared among producers
served by the processor in a fair and equitable manner that
adequately reflects producers’ production histories.
‘‘(2) ARBITRATION.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Any dispute between a processor
and a producer, or group of producers, with respect to
the sharing of the allocation to the processor shall be
resolved through arbitration by the Secretary on the
request of either party.
‘‘(B) PERIOD.—The arbitration shall, to the maximum
extent practicable, be—

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—If a sugar beet processing facility is
closed and the sugar beet growers that previously delivered
beets to the facility elect to deliver their beets to another
processing company, the growers may petition the Secretary
to modify allocations under this part to allow the delivery.
‘‘(2) INCREASED ALLOCATION FOR PROCESSING COMPANY.—
The Secretary may increase the allocation to the processing
company to which the growers elect to deliver their sugar
beets, with the approval of the processing company, to a level
that does not exceed the processing capacity of the processing
company, to accommodate the change in deliveries.

proportionate shares, will be greater than the quantity
needed to enable processors to fill the allotment and provide
a normal carryover inventory of sugar.
‘‘(2) ESTABLISHMENT OF PROPORTIONATE SHARES.—If the
Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that the quantity
of sugarcane produced by producers in the area covered by
a State allotment for a crop year will be in excess of the
quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment for
the crop year and provide a normal carryover inventory of
sugar, the Secretary shall establish a proportionate share for
each sugarcane-producing farm that limits the acreage of sugar-
cane that may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed
during the crop year the allotment is in effect as provided
in this subsection. Each such proportionate share shall be sub-
ject to adjustment under paragraph (7) and section 359c(g).
‘‘(3) METHOD OF DETERMINING.—For purposes of deter-
mining proportionate shares for any crop of sugarcane:
‘‘(A) The Secretary shall establish the State’s per-acre
yield goal for a crop of sugarcane at a level (not less
than the average per-acre yield in the State for the 2
highest years from among the 1999, 2000, and 2001 crop
years, as determined by the Secretary) that will ensure
an adequate net return per pound to producers in the
State, taking into consideration any available production
research data that the Secretary considers relevant.
‘‘(B) The Secretary shall adjust the per-acre yield goal
by the average recovery rate of sugar produced from sugar-
cane by processors in the State.
‘‘(C) The Secretary shall convert the State allotment
for the crop year involved into a State acreage allotment
for the crop by dividing the State allotment by the per-
acre yield goal for the State, as established under subpara-
graph (A) and as further adjusted under subparagraph
(B). ‘‘(D) The Secretary shall establish a uniform reduction
percentage for the crop by dividing the State acreage allot-
ment, as determined for the crop under subparagraph (C),
by the sum of all adjusted acreage bases in the State,
as determined by the Secretary.
‘‘(E) The uniform reduction percentage for the crop,
as determined under subparagraph (D), shall be applied
to the acreage base for each sugarcane-producing farm
in the State to determine the farm’s proportionate share
of sugarcane acreage that may be harvested for sugar
or seed.
‘‘(4) ACREAGE BASE.—For purposes of this subsection, the
acreage base for each sugarcane-producing farm shall be deter-
mined by the Secretary, as follows:
‘‘(A) The acreage base for any farm shall be the number
of acres that is equal to the average of the acreage planted
and considered planted for harvest for sugar or seed on
the farm in the 2 highest of the 1999, 2000, and 2001
crop years.

a farm were unable to harvest to sugarcane for sugar
or seed because of drought, flood, other natural disaster,
or other condition beyond the control of the producers may

be considered as harvested for the production of sugar
or seed for purposes of this paragraph.
‘‘(5) VIOLATION.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Whenever proportionate shares are
in effect in a State for a crop of sugarcane, producers
on a farm shall not knowingly harvest, or allow to be
harvested, for sugar or seed an acreage of sugarcane in
excess of the farm’s proportionate share for the crop year,
or otherwise violate proportionate share regulations issued
by the Secretary under section 359h(a).
‘‘(B) DETERMINATION OF VIOLATION.—No producer shall
be considered to have violated subparagraph (A) unless
the processor of the sugarcane harvested by such producer
from acreage in excess of the proportionate share of the
farm markets an amount of sugar that exceeds the alloca-
tion of such processor for a crop year.
‘‘(C) CIVIL PENALTY.—Any producer on a farm who
violates subparagraph (A) by knowingly harvesting, or
allowing to be harvested, an acreage of sugarcane in excess
of the farm’s proportionate share shall be liable to the
Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty equal
to one and one-half times the United States market value
of the quantity of sugar that is marketed by the processor
of such sugarcane in excess of the allocation of such proc-
essor for the crop year. The Secretary shall prorate pen-
alties imposed under this subparagraph in a fair and equi-
table manner among all the producers of sugarcane har-
vested from excess acreage that is acquired by such proc-
essor.
‘‘(6) WAIVER.—Notwithstanding the preceding subpara-
graph, the Secretary may authorize the county and State
committees established under section 8(b) of the Soil Conserva-
tion and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(b)) to waive
or modify deadlines and other proportionate share requirements
in cases in which lateness or failure to meet the other require-
ments does not affect adversely the operation of proportionate
shares.
‘‘(7) ADJUSTMENTS.—Whenever the Secretary determines
that, because of a natural disaster or other condition beyond
the control of producers that adversely affects a crop of sugar-
cane subject to proportionate shares, the amount of sugarcane
produced by producers subject to the proportionate shares will
not be sufficient to enable processors in the State to meet
the State’s cane sugar allotment and provide a normal carryover
inventory of sugar, the Secretary may uniformly allow pro-
ducers to harvest an amount of sugarcane in excess of their
proportionate share, or suspend proportionate shares entirely,
as necessary to enable processors to meet the State allotment
and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar.
‘‘(8) PROCESSING FACILITY CLOSURES.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If a sugarcane processing facility
subject to this subsection is closed and the sugarcane
growers that delivered sugarcane to the facility prior to
closure elect to deliver their sugarcane to another proc-
essing company, the growers may petition the Secretary
to modify allocations under this part to allow the delivery.

the written consent of all owners of a farm, may transfer the
acreage base history of the farm to any other parcels of land
of the applicant.
‘‘(b) PRESERVATION OF ACREAGE BASE HISTORY.—If for reasons
beyond the control of a producer on a farm, the producer is unable
to harvest an acreage of sugarcane for sugar or seed with respect
to all or a portion of the proportionate share established for the
farm under section 359f(c), the Secretary, on the application of
the producer and with the written consent of all owners of the
farm, may preserve for a period of not more than 5 consecutive
years the acreage base history of the farm to the extent of the
proportionate share involved. The Secretary may permit the propor-
tionate share to be redistributed to other farms, but no acreage
base history for purposes of establishing acreage bases shall accrue
to the other farms by virtue of the redistribution of the propor-
tionate share.
‘‘(c) REVISIONS OF ALLOCATIONS AND PROPORTIONATE SHARES.—
The Secretary, after such notice as the Secretary by regulation
may prescribe, may revise or amend any allocation of a marketing
allotment under section 359d, or any proportionate share estab-
lished or adjusted for a farm under section 359f(c), on the same
basis as the initial allocation or proportionate share was required
to be established.

tion for such shares, may deliver sugarcane to another proc-
essing company if the additional delivery, when combined with
such other processing company’s existing deliveries, does not
exceed the processing capacity of the company.

PROGRAMS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—

demic of ethnic, sectarian, and criminal violence;
(2) poverty, hunger, political uncertainty, and social insta-
bility are the principal causes of violence and conflict around
the world;
(3) broad-based, equitable economic growth and agriculture
development facilitates political stability, food security, democ-
racy, and the rule of law;
(4) democratic governments are more likely to advocate
and observe international laws, protect civil and human rights,
pursue free market economies, and avoid external conflicts;
(5) the United States Agency for International Development
has provided critical democracy and governance assistance to
a majority of the nations that successfully made the transition
to democratic governments during the past 2 decades;
(6) 43 of the top 50 consumer nations of American agricul-
tural products were once United States foreign aid recipients;
(7) in the past 50 years, infant child death rates in the
developing world have been reduced by 50 percent, and health
conditions around the world have improved more during this
period than in any other period;
(8) the United States Agency for International Development
child survival programs have significantly contributed to a 10
percent reduction in infant mortality rates worldwide in just
the past 8 years;

only $2 per day;
(11) 95 percent of new births occur in developing countries,
including the world’s poorest countries; and
(12) only 1⁄2 percent of the Federal budget is dedicated
to international economic and humanitarian assistance.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) United States foreign assistance programs should play
an increased role in the global fight against terrorism to com-
plement the national security objectives of the United States;
(2) the United States should lead coordinated international
efforts to provide increased financial assistance to countries
with impoverished and disadvantaged populations that are the
breeding grounds for terrorism; and

and the Department of Agriculture should substantially
increase humanitarian, economic development, and agricultural
assistance to foster international peace and stability and the

SEC. 3210. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AGRICULTURAL
TRADE.
(a) AGRICULTURE TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.—It is the
sense of the Senate that the principal negotiating objective of the
United States with respect to agricultural trade in all multilateral,
regional, and bilateral negotiations is to obtain competitive
opportunities for the export of United States agricultural commod-
ities in foreign markets substantially equivalent to the competitive
opportunities afforded foreign exports in United States markets
and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of agricultural
trade in bulk and value-added commodities by—
(1) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or
other charges that decrease market opportunities for the export
of United States agricultural commodities, giving priority to
United States agricultural commodities that are subject to
significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major pro-
ducing countries;
(2) immediately eliminating all export subsidies on agricul-
tural commodities worldwide while maintaining bona fide food
aid and preserving United States agricultural market develop-
ment and export credit programs that allow the United States
to compete with other foreign export promotion efforts;
(3) leveling the playing field for United States agricultural
producers by disciplining domestic supports such that no other
country can provide greater support, measured as a percentage
of total agricultural production value, than the United States
does while preserving existing green box category to support
conservation activities, family farms, and rural communities;
(4) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules and
effective dispute settlement mechanisms to eliminate practices
that unfairly decrease United States market access opportuni-
ties for United States agricultural commodities or distort agri-
cultural markets to the detriment of the United States,
including—
(A) unfair or trade-distorting activities of state trading
enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with
emphasis on—

116 STAT. 304 PUBLIC LAW 107–171—MAY 13, 2002
(i) requiring price transparency in the operation
of state trading enterprises and such other mecha-
nisms; and
(ii) ending discriminatory pricing practices for agri-
cultural commodities that amount to de facto export
subsidies so that the enterprises or other mechanisms
do not (except in cases of bona fide food aid) sell
agricultural commodities in foreign markets at prices
below domestic market prices or prices below the full
costs of acquiring and delivering agricultural commod-
ities to the foreign markets;
(B) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial require-
ments affecting new agricultural technologies, including
biotechnology;
(C) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions,
including restrictions that are not based on scientific prin-
ciples, in contravention of the Agreement on the Application
of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (as described in
section 101(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act
(19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));
(D) other unjustified technical barriers to agricultural
trade; and
(E) restrictive and nontransparent rules in the
administration of tariff rate quotas;
(5) improving import relief mechanisms to recognize the
unique characteristics of perishable agricultural commodities;
(6) taking into account whether a party to negotiations
with respect to trading in an agricultural commodity has—
(A) failed to adhere to the provisions of an existing
bilateral trade agreement with the United States;
(B) circumvented obligations under a multilateral trade
agreement to which the United States is a signatory; or
(C) manipulated its currency value to the detriment
of United States agricultural producers or exporters; and
(7) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the
World Trade Organization—
(A) have made meaningful market liberalization
commitments in agriculture; and
(B) make progress in fulfilling those commitments over
time.
(b) PRIORITY FOR AGRICULTURE TRADE.—It is the sense of the
Senate that—
(1) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should
be the top priority of United States negotiators in World Trade
Organization talks; and
(2) if the primary export competitors of the United States
fail to reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and
eliminate export subsidies in accordance with the negotiating
objectives expressed in this section, the United States should
take steps to increase the leverage of United States negotiators
and level the playing field for United States producers, within
existing World Trade Organization commitments.
(c) CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.—It is
the sense of the Senate that—

116 STAT. 305PUBLIC LAW 107–171—MAY 13, 2002
(1) before the United States Trade Representative nego-
tiates a trade agreement that would reduce tariffs on agricul-
tural commodities or require a change in United States agricul-
tural law, the United States Trade Representative should con-
sult with the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee
on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the
Committee on Finance of the Senate;
(2) not less than 48 hours before initialing an agreement
relating to agricultural trade negotiated under the auspices
of the World Trade Organization, the United States Trade
Representative should consult closely with the committees
referred to in paragraph (1) regarding—
(A) the details of the agreement;
(B) the potential impact of the agreement on United
States agricultural producers; and
(C) any changes in United States law necessary to
implement the agreement; and
(3) any agreement or other understanding (whether verbal
or in writing) that relates to agricultural trade that is not
disclosed to Congress before legislation implementing a trade
agreement is introduced in either the Senate or the House
of Representatives should not be considered to be part of the
agreement approved by Congress and should have no force
and effect under Unites States law or in any dispute settlement
body.

(a) SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.—
(1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the
‘‘Congressional Hunger Fellows Act of 2002’’.
(2) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows:
(A) There is a critical need for compassionate individ-
uals who are committed to assisting people who suffer
from hunger as well as a need for such individuals to
initiate and administer solutions to the hunger problem.
(B) Bill Emerson, the distinguished late Representative
from the 8th District of Missouri, demonstrated his commit-
ment to solving the problem of hunger in a bipartisan
manner, his commitment to public service, and his great
affection for the institution and the ideals of the United
States Congress.
(C) George T. (Mickey) Leland, the distinguished late
Representative from the 18th District of Texas, dem-
onstrated his compassion for those in need, his high regard
for public service, and his lively exercise of political talents.
(D) The special concern that Mr. Emerson and Mr.
Leland demonstrated during their lives for the hungry
and poor was an inspiration for others to work toward
the goals of equality and justice for all.
(E) These two outstanding leaders maintained a special
bond of friendship regardless of political affiliation and
worked together to encourage future leaders to recognize
and provide service to others, and therefore it is especially
appropriate to honor the memory of Mr. Emerson and
Mr. Leland by creating a fellowship program to develop
and train the future leaders of the United States to pursue
careers in humanitarian service.
(b) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established as an independent
entity of the legislative branch of the United States Government
