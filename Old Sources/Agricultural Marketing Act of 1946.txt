Subtitle A—General Provisions
SEC. 202. ø7 U.S.C. 1621¿ The Congress hereby declares that
a sound, efficient, and privately operated system for distributing
and marketing agricultural products is essential to a prosperous
agriculture and is indispensable to the maintenance of full employ-
ment and to the welfare, prosperity, and health of the Nation. It
is further declared to be the policy of Congress to promote through
research, study, experimentation, and through cooperation among
Federal and State agencies, farm organizations, and private indus-
try a scientific approach to the problems of marketing, transpor-
tation, and distribution of agricultural products similar to the sci-

entific methods which have been utilized so successfully during the
past eighty-four years in connection with the production of agricul-
tural products so that such products capable of being produced in
abundance may be marketed in an orderly manner and efficiently
distributed. In order to attain these objectives, it is the intent of
Congress to provide for (1) continuous research to improve the mar-
keting, handling, storage, processing, transportation, and distribu-
tion of agricultural products; (2) cooperation among Federal and
State agencies, producers, industry organizations, and others in the
development and effectuation of research and marketing programs
to improve the distribution processes; (3) an integrated administra-
tion of all laws enacted by Congress to aid the distribution of agri-
cultural products through research, market aids and services, and
regulatory activities, to the end that marketing methods and facili-
ties may be improved, that distribution costs may be reduced and
the price spread between the producer and consumer may be nar-
rowed, that dietary and nutritional standards may be improved,
that new and wider markets for American agricultural products
may be developed, both in the United States and in other countries,
with a view to making it possible for the full production of Amer-
ican farms to be disposed of usefully, economically, profitably, and
in an orderly manner. In effectuating the purposes of this title,
maximum use shall by made of existing research facilities owned
or controlled by the Federal Government or by State agricultural
experiment stations and of the facilities of the Federal and State
extension services. To the maximum extent practicable marketing
research work done hereunder in cooperation with the States shall
be done in cooperation with the State agricultural experiment sta-
tions; marketing educational and demonstrational work done here-
under in cooperation with the States shall be done in cooperation
with the State agricultural extension service; market information,
inspection, regulatory work and other marketing service done here-
under in cooperation with the State agencies shall be done in co-
operation with the State departments of agriculture, and State bu-
reaus and departments of markets.
SEC. 203. ø7 U.S.C. 1622¿ The Secretary of Agriculture is di-
rected and authorized:
(a) To conduct, assist, and foster research, investigation, and
experimentation to determine the best methods of processing, prep-
aration for market, packaging, handling, transporting, storing, dis-
tributing, and marketing agricultural products: Provided, That the
results of such research shall be made available to the public for
the purpose of expanding the use of American agricultural products
in such manner as the Secretary of Agriculture may determine.
(b) To determine costs of marketing agricultural products in
their various forms and through the various channels and to foster
and assist in the development and establishment of more efficient
marketing methods (including analyses of methods and proposed
methods), practices, and facilities, for the purpose of bringing about
more efficient and orderly marketing, and reducing the price
spread between the producer and the consumer.
(c) To develop and improve standards of quality, condition,
quantity, grade, and packaging, and recommend and demonstrate
such standards in order to encourage uniformity and consistency in

lated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 (Public Law 106–78; 113 Stat. 1165; 7 U.S.C. 1622

departments of markets, State agricultural experiment stations,
and other appropriate State agencies for cooperative projects in

agency makes available out of its own funds for such research. The
funds which State agencies are required to make available in order
to qualify for such an allotment shall be in addition to any funds
now available to such agencies for marketing services and for mar-
keting research. The allotments authorized under this section shall
be made to the agency or agencies best equipped and qualified to
conduct the specific project to be undertaken. Such allotments shall
be covered by cooperative agreements between the Secretary of Ag-
riculture and the cooperating agency and shall include appropriate
provisions for preventing duplication or overlapping of work within
the State or States cooperating. Should duplication or overlapping
occur subsequent to approval of a cooperative project or allotment
of funds, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed to
withhold unexpended balances on such projects notwithstanding
the prior approval thereof.
SEC. 205. ø7 U.S.C. 1624¿ (a) In carrying out the provisions of
title II of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture may cooperate with
other branches of the Government, State agencies, private research
organizations, purchasing and consuming organizations, boards of
trade, chambers of commerce, other associations of business or
trade organizations, transportation and storage agencies and orga-
nizations, or other persons or corporations engaged in the produc-
tion, transportation, storing, processing, marketing, and distribu-
tion of agricultural products whether operating in one or more ju-
risdictions. The Secretary of Agriculture shall have authority to
enter into contracts and agreements under the terms of regulations
promulgated by him with States and agencies of States, private
firms, institutions, and individuals for the purpose of conducting
research and service work, making and compiling reports and sur-
veys, and carrying out other functions relating thereto when in his
judgment the services or functions to be performed will be carried
out more effectively, more rapidly, or at less cost than if performed
by the Department of Agriculture. Contracts hereunder may be
made for work to be performed within a period not more than four
years from the date of any such contract, and advance, progress,
or other payments may be made. The provisions of section 3648 (31
U.S.C., sec. 529) and section 3709 (41 U.S.C., sec. 5) of the Revised
Statutes shall not be applicable to contracts or agreements made
under the authority of this section. Any unexpended balances of ap-
propriations obligated by contracts as authorized by this section
may, notwithstanding the provisions of section 5 of the Act of June
20, 1874, as amended (31 U.S.C., sec. 713), remain upon the books
of the Treasury for not more than five fiscal years before being car-
ried to the surplus fund and covered into the Treasury. Any con-
tract made pursuant to this section shall contain requirements
making the result of such research and investigations available to
the public by such means as the Secretary of Agriculture shall de-
termine.
(b) The Secretary of Agriculture shall promulgate such orders,
rules, and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the pro-
visions of this title.

of each and every agency, division, bureau, service, section, or other
administrative unit in the Department of Agriculture primarily
concerned with research, service, or regulatory activities in connec-

sonnel, and funds of such agencies, divisions, bureaus, services,
sections, or other administrative units in the Department of Agri-

essary to the administration of this title: Provided, That the Sec-
retary of Agriculture may appoint and fix the compensation of any
technically qualified person, firm, or organization by contract or
otherwise on a temporary basis and for a term not to exceed six
months in any fiscal year to perform research, inspection, classi-
